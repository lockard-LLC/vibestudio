## The Repository

This repository, known as "Code - OSS," is where we at Microsoft develop the [Visual Studio Code](URL_7) product in collaboration with the community. Here, we not only work on code and track issues but also publish our [roadmap](URL_8), [monthly iteration plans](URL_9), and [endgame plans](URL_10). The source code is available to everyone under the standard [MIT license](URL_11).).
