# Deployment Guide

This guide provides instructions and best practices for deploying the platform to various environments. It covers general deployment strategies, containerization with Docker, and considerations for cloud deployments.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the platform, ensure you have:
*   A stable, tested version of the application from your version control system (e.g., a release branch or tag).
*   Access to the target deployment environment (server, cloud account, Kubernetes cluster).
*   All necessary configuration values (environment variables, secrets) for the target environment. See the [Configuration Guide](./03-configuration-guide/README.md).
*   Build artifacts prepared, if your application requires a build step (e.g., compiled frontend assets, compiled backend code).

## General Deployment Strategies

### 1. Manual Deployment (Not Recommended for Production)
Suitable for initial testing or very small setups.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  SSH into the target server.
    2.  Clone or pull the latest code from the repository.
    3.  Install dependencies.
    4.  Configure environment variables (e.g., in `.bashrc`, systemd unit file, or by exporting them before running).
    5.  Build the application (if necessary).
    6.  Run database migrations.
    7.  Start the application using a process manager (e.g., PM2, systemd, Supervisor).
*   **Pros:** Simple for one-off deployments.
*   **Cons:** Error-prone, not scalable, difficult to roll back, lacks automation.

### 2. Automated Deployment with CI/CD
This is the recommended approach for staging and production environments.
*   **Tools:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, CircleCI, AWS CodeDeploy, Google Cloud Build.
*   **General Workflow:**
    1.  **Commit/Push:** Developer pushes code to a specific branch (e.g., `main`, `release/*`).
    2.  **CI Server Trigger:** The CI server detects the change and triggers a pipeline.
    3.  **Build:** The pipeline checks out the code, installs dependencies, runs linters and tests. If a build step is required, it generates build artifacts.
    4.  **Package (Optional):** The application (and its dependencies) might be packaged into a container image (e.g., Docker).
    5.  **Deploy:** The CI/CD pipeline deploys the new version to the target environment. This might involve:
        *   Copying files to servers.
        *   Updating container images in a registry and rolling out updates (e.g., in Kubernetes).
        *   Running database migrations.
        *   Restarting application services.
    6.  **Post-Deployment:** Run health checks, smoke tests. Notify stakeholders.
*   **Pros:** Consistent, reliable, automated, enables rollbacks, integrates testing.
*   **Cons:** Requires initial setup and maintenance of the CI/CD pipeline.

### Deployment Checklist
*   [ ] Backup database before deploying schema changes.
*   [ ] Ensure all environment variables and secrets are correctly configured for the target environment.
*   [ ] Run database migrations.
*   [ ] Deploy application code/binaries/containers.
*   [ ] Restart application services gracefully (zero-downtime deployment if possible).
*   [ ] Perform health checks and monitor logs immediately after deployment.
*   [ ] Have a rollback plan in case of issues.

## Containerization with Docker

Docker allows you to package the application and its dependencies into a portable container image. This ensures consistency across different environments.

### `Dockerfile`
A `Dockerfile` defines the steps to build your application image. There might be separate Dockerfiles for the frontend and backend if they are distinct applications.

**Example `Dockerfile` (Node.js Backend):**
```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build stage (if using TypeScript or a build step)
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --only=production --ignore-scripts # Or yarn install --production --frozen-lockfile
COPY . .
# RUN npm run build # If you have a build script (e.g., tsc)

# Stage 2: Production stage
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Set NODE_ENV to production
ENV NODE_ENV=production

# Copy dependencies from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app/package*.json ./
# Copy built application code from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app/dist ./dist # Assuming build output is in 'dist'
# Or if no build step, copy source code
# COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app/src ./src

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 8080

# Command to run the application
CMD [ "node", "dist/main.js" ] # Or your app's entry point
```
[**Provide example Dockerfiles relevant to your platform's tech stack, e.g., for frontend, Python, Java, Go applications.**]

### `docker-compose.yml` (for Development and Multi-Container Setups)
While primarily for development, `docker-compose` can also be used for simpler single-server deployments, though tools like Kubernetes are preferred for production orchestration.

**Example `docker-compose.yml`:**
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app_backend:
    build:
      context: ./backend # Path to backend Dockerfile
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: your-repo/platform-backend:${TAG:-latest} # Use a tag for versioning
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - PORT=8080
      - DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL} # Pass through from .env file or environment
      - JWT_SECRET=${JWT_SECRET}
      # ... other environment variables
    depends_on:
      - db
    restart: unless-stopped

  app_frontend: # If frontend is also containerized
    build:
      context: ./frontend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: your-repo/platform-frontend:${TAG:-latest}
    ports:
      - "3000:80" # Assuming frontend serves on port 80 in container
    restart: unless-stopped

  db:
    image: postgres:14-alpine
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=${POSTGRES_USER}
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
      - POSTGRES_DB=${POSTGRES_DB}
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```
[**Adjust this example to match your platform's services.**]

### Building and Pushing Docker Images
1.  **Build the image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t your-registry/your-app-name:tag ./path-to-dockerfile-dir
    # Example:
    # docker build -t myorg/platform-api:v1.2.0 ./backend
    ```
2.  **Tag the image (if needed for different registries/names):**
    ```bash
    docker tag source-image:tag target-image:tag
    ```
3.  **Push to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR, Google GCR, Azure ACR):**
    ```bash
    docker login your-registry.com # Login if necessary
    docker push your-registry/your-app-name:tag
    ```
    This is typically done by the CI/CD pipeline.

## Cloud Deployment

Deploying to cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.) offers scalability, managed services, and robustness.

### Common Cloud Deployment Models:
1.  **Virtual Machines (IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service):**
    *   **Services:** AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure Virtual Machines.
    *   **Process:** Provision VMs, install dependencies, configure networking and security groups, deploy your application (manually or via CI/CD, potentially using Docker containers on the VMs).
    *   **Pros:** Full control over the environment.
    *   **Cons:** More management overhead (OS patching, scaling).

2.  **Container Orchestration (PaaS/CaaS - Platform/Containers as a Service):**
    *   **Services:** AWS EKS/ECS, Google GKE, Azure AKS, Managed Kubernetes services.
    *   **Process:** Package your application into Docker containers, push to a container registry, define your deployment configuration (e.g., Kubernetes YAML files for Deployments, Services, Ingress), and apply it to the cluster.
    *   **Pros:** Automated scaling, self-healing, rolling updates, efficient resource utilization.
    *   **Cons:** Steeper learning curve for Kubernetes.

3.  **Platform as a Service (PaaS):**
    *   **Services:** AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, Azure App Service, Heroku.
    *   **Process:** Push your code (or a Docker container) and the PaaS handles the underlying infrastructure, scaling, load balancing, and deployment.
    *   **Pros:** Simplified deployment and management, faster time to market.
    *   **Cons:** Less control over the underlying infrastructure, potential vendor lock-in.

4.  **Serverless Functions (FaaS - Functions as a Service):**
    *   **Services:** AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions.
    *   **Process:** Deploy individual functions or small services. Suitable for event-driven parts of your application or APIs.
    *   **Pros:** Pay-per-use, automatic scaling, no server management.
    *   **Cons:** Limitations on execution time, state management can be complex, best for specific use cases rather than entire monolithic apps.

### General Cloud Deployment Considerations:
*   **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Configure appropriate roles and permissions for your deployed services to access other cloud resources (e.g., databases, storage) securely.
*   **Networking:** Set up VPCs/VNETs, subnets, security groups/firewall rules, load balancers, and DNS.
*   **Databases:** Use managed database services (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure Database) for reliability, backups, and scaling.
*   **Storage:** Utilize object storage (AWS S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage) for static assets, user uploads, and backups.
*   **Logging and Monitoring:** Integrate with cloud-native monitoring and logging services (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Google Cloud Operations, Azure Monitor).
*   **Cost Management:** Monitor and optimize cloud resource usage to control costs.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Use tools like Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, or Azure Resource Manager to define and manage your cloud infrastructure programmatically. This enables versioning, repeatability, and automation.

## Zero-Downtime Deployments
Achieving zero-downtime (or near-zero-downtime) deployments is crucial for production systems. Strategies include:
*   **Rolling Updates:** Gradually replace old instances/pods with new ones. Load balancers direct traffic to healthy instances. (Common in Kubernetes, PaaS).
*   **Blue/Green Deployment:** Deploy the new version to a separate identical environment ("green"). Once tested, switch traffic from the old environment ("blue") to the new one. Easy rollback by switching traffic back.
*   **Canary Releases:** Release the new version to a small subset of users/servers first. Monitor closely. If successful, gradually roll out to everyone.

## Database Migrations
*   Database schema changes must be managed carefully.
*   Use a migration tool (e.g., Flyway, Liquibase, Alembic, Django migrations, Knex migrations).
*   Migrations should be:
    *   **Versioned:** Tracked in version control.
    *   **Repeatable:** Can be run multiple times without issues.
    *   **Reversible (if possible):** Have corresponding rollback scripts for critical changes.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Apply backward-compatible schema changes first (e.g., adding nullable columns, new tables).
    2.  Deploy application code that can work with both old and new schemas.
    3.  Apply breaking schema changes (e.g., dropping columns, renaming tables) and deploy code that relies solely on the new schema.
    *   Alternatively, for some changes, put the application in maintenance mode briefly.

## Post-Deployment
*   **Health Checks:** Implement `/health` or similar endpoints that your load balancer or orchestration system can use to verify application health.
*   **Smoke Testing:** Automated or manual tests to verify critical functionalities immediately after deployment.
*   **Monitoring:** Closely monitor application logs, error rates, performance metrics (CPU, memory, response times) after deployment.
*   **Alerting:** Set up alerts for critical errors or performance degradation.

This deployment guide provides a starting point. The specific steps and tools will depend on your platform's technology stack and the target environment. Always prioritize automation, consistency, and safety in your deployment processes.
