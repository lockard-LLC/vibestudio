# VSCode RPC Protocol Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for Visual Studio Code's Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocol, which enables communication between the main workbench process and extension host processes.

## Quick Start

The VSCode RPC protocol is a binary message-passing system that provides:

- **Type-safe communication** between processes via proxy objects
- **Bidirectional method calls** with Promise-based responses
- **Cancellation support** for long-running operations
- **Efficient serialization** for complex data types including buffers
- **Error handling** with stack trace preservation
- **Responsiveness monitoring** to detect unresponsive extension hosts

## Key Files

The RPC protocol implementation is located in:

- `src/vs/workbench/services/extensions/common/rpcProtocol.ts` - Core protocol implementation
- `src/vs/workbench/services/extensions/common/proxyIdentifier.ts` - Proxy system and identifiers
- `src/vs/workbench/api/common/extHost.protocol.ts` - Extension host protocol definitions
- `src/vs/base/parts/ipc/common/ipc.ts` - Underlying message passing interface

## Protocol Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main Process
    participant E as Extension Host Process
    
    M->>E: Method Call (with args)
    E-->>M: Acknowledge
    Note over E: Execute method
    E->>M: Response (success/error)
    Note over M: Promise resolved
```

1. **Proxy Creation**: Type-safe proxies are created for remote objects
2. **Method Invocation**: Methods on proxies become RPC calls
3. **Serialization**: Arguments are serialized with buffer reference handling
4. **Acknowledgment**: Immediate ack to track responsiveness
5. **Execution**: Method executed on remote side with error handling
6. **Response**: Result serialized and returned via Promise

## Architecture

The RPC system follows a layered architecture:

    D --> E[Transport Layer<br/>IPC/WebWorker/etc.]

    class A,B,C,D,E layer
```

Each layer provides specific abstractions and capabilities for robust inter-process communication.
