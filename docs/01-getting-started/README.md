## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software and tools installed on your system. This setup assumes a Node.js backend, a React frontend, and PostgreSQL database, commonly managed with Docker for local development.

*   **Operating System:**
    *   Linux (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later)
    *   macOS (e.g., 12.0 Monterey or later)
    *   Windows 10/11 with WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) enabled and a Linux distribution installed.
*   **Version Control:**
    *   Git: Version 2.30+
*   **Node.js (for Backend and Frontend Tooling):**
    *   Node.js: Version 18.x LTS or 20.x LTS recommended.
    *   npm: Version 8.x+ (usually comes with Node.js) or Yarn: Version 1.22.x+ / Berry (2.x+). We'll use `npm` in examples.
*   **Database (if running locally outside Docker):**
    *   PostgreSQL: Version 14+ (though Docker setup is preferred for consistency).
*   **Containerization (Highly Recommended for Local Development):**
    *   Docker Engine: Version 20.10+
    *   Docker Compose: Version 2.x (often bundled with Docker Desktop) or standalone v1.29+.
*   **Code Editor/IDE:**
    *   A modern code editor like VS Code (recommended with extensions for JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Docker, ESLint, Prettier), IntelliJ IDEA, WebStorm, etc.
*   **Web Browser:**
    *   A modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari for accessing the frontend.

Please refer to the official documentation for each tool to ensure proper installation and configuration on your specific operating system.

## Quick Start: Local Development Setup

This guide will walk you through setting up a local development environment for the platform using Docker Compose, which is the recommended method for consistency.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/autonomous-coding-agent.git # Replace with your actual repository URL
cd autonomous-coding-agent
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

The platform uses environment variables for configuration. An example file is provided.

*   Copy the example environment file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
*   Open the `.env` file in your editor. Review and update the variables as needed for your local setup.
    Key variables you **must** typically set or verify:
    *   `NODE_ENV=development`
    *   `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://agent_user:strong_password@db:5432/agent_db` (This usually works with the default Docker Compose setup. Ensure `agent_user`, `strong_password`, and `agent_db` match `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, and `POSTGRES_DB` if they are also in the `.env` file for Docker's PostgreSQL service).
    *   `POSTGRES_USER=agent_user` (For the Dockerized PostgreSQL service)
    *   `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=strong_password` (Choose a strong password for local dev)
    *   `POSTGRES_DB=agent_db`
    *   `JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_please_change_me` (Generate a strong random string)
    *   `SERVER_PORT=8080` (Port the backend server will listen on inside its container)
    *   `CLIENT_PORT=3000` (Port the React development server will listen on)
    *   `OPENAI_API_KEY=` (If integrating with OpenAI, add your key here)
    *   `[OTHER_AI_SERVICE_API_KEYS]` (Add other AI service keys as needed)

    The `.env.example` should list all possible variables with explanations.

### 3. Build and Run with Docker Compose

This command will build the Docker images for the backend server, frontend client, and database (if not already built), and then start all services.

*   Ensure Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine + Docker Compose) is running.
*   From the project root directory (where `docker-compose.yml` is located):
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
    *   `--build`: Forces Docker to rebuild the images if there are changes in `Dockerfile` or related files.
    *   `-d`: Runs containers in detached mode (in the background).

### 4. Database Setup (Migrations & Seeding)

Once the Docker containers are running, you'll likely need to run database migrations to set up the schema and potentially seed initial data. These commands are typically run *inside* the running backend container.

*   **Run database migrations:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec server npm run db:migrate
    ```
    (Assuming your backend service is named `server` in `docker-compose.yml` and you have an `npm run db:migrate` script in its `package.json`).

*   **(Optional) Seed the database:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec server npm run db:seed
    ```
    (Assuming an `npm run db:seed` script).

    *Note: The exact commands (`npm run db:migrate`, `db:seed`) depend on the ORM and migration tools used in your Node.js backend (e.g., Sequelize, Knex, TypeORM).*

### 5. Accessing the Application

Once all services are up and migrations/seeding are complete:

*   **Frontend (React App):** Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the `CLIENT_PORT` you configured in `.env`).
*   **Backend API:** The API will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:8080/api` (or the `SERVER_PORT` you configured, with `/api` being a common base path). The frontend will be configured to make requests to this backend.

### Managing Docker Compose Services

*   **View Logs:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f # View logs for all services
    docker-compose logs -f server # View logs for the 'server' service
    docker-compose logs -f client # View logs for the 'client' service
    ```
*   **Stop Services:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose down # Stops and removes containers, networks, and volumes (unless specified otherwise)
    ```
*   **Stop Services (without removing volumes):**
    ```bash
    docker-compose stop # Stops running containers without removing them
    ```
*   **Restart Services:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose restart server client
    ```

### Alternative: Running Services Natively (Without Docker - for specific component development)

While Docker Compose is recommended, you might want to run services natively for deeper debugging or specific development tasks. This requires setting up Node.js, PostgreSQL, etc., directly on your machine (as per Prerequisites) and managing environment variables differently.

1.  **Setup PostgreSQL:** Install PostgreSQL, create a user and database.
2.  **Configure `.env`:** Update `DATABASE_URL` to point to your native PostgreSQL instance (e.g., `postgresql://your_local_user:your_local_pass@localhost:5432/your_local_db`).
3.  **Backend (`/server` directory):**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    npm run db:migrate # Against your native DB
    npm run db:seed   # Optional
    npm run dev       # Or your start script, e.g., starts on port 8080
    ```
4.  **Frontend (`/client` directory):**
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    npm start         # Usually starts React dev server on port 3000
    ```
    Ensure the frontend's API proxy or request URLs are configured to point to the natively running backend (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).
