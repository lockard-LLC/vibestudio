# CI/CD and DevOps

This guide describes the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, versioning system, environment variable management, containerization strategies (Docker, Kubernetes if used), and how to manage staging versus production environments for the platform.

## Overview

A robust DevOps culture and CI/CD pipeline are essential for delivering high-quality software reliably and efficiently. This involves:
*   **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automatically building, testing, and integrating code changes frequently.
*   **Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD):** Automatically deploying validated changes to staging and production environments.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Managing infrastructure (servers, databases, networks) through code.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:** Continuously monitoring application performance and health, and collecting logs for troubleshooting.
*   **Collaboration and Communication:** Strong collaboration between development, operations, and QA teams.

## Version Control System

*   **Primary VCS:** Git.
*   **Repository Hosting:** [**Specify: e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure Repos**]
*   **Branching Strategy:**
    *   [**Describe your branching model. Examples:**]
    *   **GitFlow (Common for released software):**
        *   `main` (or `master`): Represents production-ready code. Only receives merges from `release` branches or hotfix branches. Tagged for releases.
        *   `develop`: Integration branch for features. All feature branches are merged into `develop`.
        *   `feature/*`: Individual feature branches, branched from `develop`.
        *   `release/*`: Branched from `develop` when preparing for a release. Bug fixes and stabilization happen here. Merged into `main` and back into `develop`.
        *   `hotfix/*`: Branched from `main` to fix critical production bugs. Merged into `main` and back into `develop`.
    *   **GitHub Flow (Simpler, good for continuous deployment):**
        *   `main`: Always deployable.
        *   `feature/*` (or descriptive names): Branched from `main`. Code is tested here. Merged back into `main` via Pull/Merge Request after review and passing tests, then deployed.
    *   **Trunk-Based Development:** All developers commit to a single `main` (trunk) branch. Features might be developed in short-lived feature branches or directly on trunk using feature flags. Requires strong automated testing.
*   **Commit Messages:** [**Specify conventions, e.g., Conventional Commits (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)**]
    *   Example: `feat: add user profile page`
    *   Example: `fix: resolve issue with login form validation`
*   **Pull/Merge Requests (PRs/MRs):**
    *   All code changes to protected branches (`main`, `develop`) must go through PRs/MRs.
    *   Require code reviews (e.g., at least one approval).
    *   Require CI checks (build, tests, linting) to pass before merging.

## CI/CD Pipeline

[**Describe the CI/CD tool(s) used: e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, CircleCI, Azure DevOps Pipelines, AWS CodePipeline.**]

### Pipeline Stages (Typical Flow):

1.  **Trigger:**
    *   Push to a feature branch.
    *   Creation of a Pull/Merge Request.
    *   Merge to `develop` or `main`.
    *   Scheduled trigger (e.g., nightly builds).

2.  **Checkout Code:**
    *   Pipeline checks out the relevant branch/commit.

3.  **Setup Environment:**
    *   Install necessary tools, runtimes (Node.js, Python, Java, Docker), and dependencies (e.g., `npm install`, `pip install`, `mvn install`).
    *   Cache dependencies to speed up subsequent runs.

4.  **Linting & Static Analysis:**
    *   Run code linters (e.g., ESLint, Pylint, Checkstyle).
    *   Perform static code analysis (e.g., SonarQube, CodeQL).
    *   Fail the build if issues are found.

5.  **Unit & Integration Tests:**
    *   Execute automated unit tests.
    *   Execute automated integration tests (may require setting up test databases or mock services).
    *   Collect test coverage reports.
    *   Fail the build if tests fail or coverage drops below a threshold.

6.  **Build Application:**
    *   Compile code (if necessary, e.g., TypeScript, Java, Go).
    *   Build frontend assets (e.g., `npm run build`).
    *   Package the application (e.g., create JAR/WAR files, executables).

7.  **Build Docker Image (If using containers):**
    *   Build Docker images using the `Dockerfile` for each service/application component.
    *   Tag images appropriately (e.g., with commit SHA, branch name, version number).
    *   Push images to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR, Google GCR, Azure ACR).

8.  **Security Scans:**
    *   Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities (e.g., `npm audit`, Snyk, Dependabot).
    *   Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities (e.g., Trivy, Clair, Aqua Security).
    *   Perform Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) if applicable.

9.  **Deploy to Staging Environment:**
    *   Triggered automatically on merge to `develop` or manually for a release candidate.
    *   Deploy the built application/containers to the staging environment.
    *   Run database migrations.
    *   Perform configuration management (apply environment-specific settings).

10. **End-to-End (E2E) & Smoke Tests on Staging:**
    *   Run automated E2E tests against the deployed staging environment (e.g., using Cypress, Selenium, Playwright).
    *   Perform basic smoke tests to ensure critical functionalities are working.

11. **Manual QA/Approval (Optional):**
    *   Notify QA team or stakeholders for manual testing and approval on the staging environment.
    *   May involve a manual gate in the pipeline.

12. **Deploy to Production Environment:**
    *   Triggered automatically on merge to `main` (for continuous deployment) or manually after staging approval (for continuous delivery).
    *   **Deployment Strategy:** (e.g., Blue/Green, Canary, Rolling Update). See [Deployment Guide](./04-deployment-guide.md).
    *   Run database migrations (carefully, with rollback plans).
    *   Apply production configurations.

13. **Post-Deployment Health Checks & Monitoring:**
    *   Verify application health after deployment.
    *   Monitor logs and performance metrics.

14. **Notifications:**
    *   Notify team members (e.g., via Slack, email) about build status, deployment success/failure.

[**Include a simplified diagram of your pipeline if possible.**]
[**Provide links to pipeline configuration files if they are in the repository (e.g., `.github/workflows/main.yml`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`).**]

## Environment Variables Management

Proper management of environment variables is crucial for security and configuration flexibility.

*   **Storage:**
    *   **Local Development:** `.env` files (gitignored). Loaded by tools like `dotenv`.
    *   **CI/CD System:** Securely store environment variables within the CI/CD tool's secrets management system (e.g., GitHub Secrets, GitLab CI Variables, Jenkins Credentials). These are injected into the pipeline at runtime.
    *   **Hosting Environment (Staging/Production):**
        *   **Cloud Providers:** Use built-in mechanisms (e.g., AWS Parameter Store/Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault, environment settings in App Service/Beanstalk/Lambda).
        *   **Kubernetes:** `ConfigMaps` (for non-sensitive data) and `Secrets` (for sensitive data).
        *   **Server Configuration Tools:** Ansible Vault, Chef Vault.
*   **Naming Conventions:**
    *   Use consistent naming (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `API_KEY_SERVICE_X`).
    *   Prefix with service name if ambiguous (e.g., `PAYMENT_API_KEY`, `NOTIFICATION_API_KEY`).
*   **`.env.example` File:**
    *   Maintain an `.env.example` file in the repository that lists all required environment variables with placeholder or default values. This serves as a template.
*   **Access in Application:**
    *   Application code reads variables from `process.env` (Node.js), `os.environ` (Python), etc.
    *   Configuration libraries can help manage and validate these.
*   **Security:**
    *   **Never commit actual secrets or `.env` files containing secrets to version control.**
    *   Limit access to production secrets.
    *   Rotate secrets periodically.

## Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)

[**Specify if and how containerization is used.**]

### Docker:
*   **`Dockerfile`:**
    *   Maintain optimized and secure `Dockerfile`s for each application component/service.
    *   Use multi-stage builds to keep production images small and clean.
    *   Scan images for vulnerabilities.
    *   [**Link to example Dockerfiles in the repository if available.**]
*   **`docker-compose.yml`:**
    *   Used for local development to easily spin up the application and its dependencies (databases, caches).
    *   May also be used for simpler single-server deployments.
    *   [**Link to `docker-compose.yml` if available.**]
*   **Container Registry:**
    *   [**Specify registry used: e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR, Google GCR, Azure ACR, GitLab Container Registry.**]
    *   CI/CD pipeline pushes tagged images to this registry.

### Kubernetes (K8s) (If used for orchestration):
*   **Manifest Files (YAML):**
    *   Define Kubernetes resources (Deployments, Services, Ingress, ConfigMaps, Secrets, PersistentVolumeClaims, etc.) in YAML files.
    *   Store these manifests in version control.
    *   [**Link to K8s manifest directory if available.**]
*   **Deployment Tools:**
    *   `kubectl apply -f <directory_or_file>`
    *   Helm charts for packaging and managing K8s applications.
    *   Kustomize for template-free customization of K8s manifests.
    *   GitOps tools (e.g., Argo CD, Flux) for continuous deployment to Kubernetes based on changes in a Git repository.
*   **Cluster Management:**
    *   [**Briefly mention how K8s clusters are provisioned and managed: e.g., Managed Kubernetes services (EKS, GKE, AKS), self-hosted.**]
*   **Key K8s Concepts Used:**
    *   **Deployments:** For declarative updates to Pods.
    *   **Services:** To expose applications running in Pods (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer).
    *   **Ingress:** To manage external access to services, typically HTTP/HTTPS routing.
    *   **ConfigMaps & Secrets:** For managing configuration and sensitive data.
    *   **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA):** For automatic scaling based on metrics.
    *   **Liveness & Readiness Probes:** To ensure Pod health.

## Managing Staging vs. Production Environments

*   **Isolation:** Staging and production environments must be completely isolated (networks, databases, other backing services).
*   **Parity (as much as possible):** Staging should mirror production in terms of infrastructure, software versions, and configurations to ensure accurate testing.
    *   This can be challenging for data, where staging might use sanitized or smaller datasets.
*   **Configuration Differences:** Managed via environment variables or environment-specific configuration files loaded at runtime/deploy time.
    *   Example: `DATABASE_URL` will be different for staging and production.
    *   Feature flags might be enabled differently.
*   **Deployment Process:**
    *   **Staging:** Typically deployed automatically from a `develop` or `release` branch. More frequent deployments.
    *   **Production:** Deployed from `main` or a tagged release. Deployments are more controlled, often requiring approval, and may use strategies like blue/green or canary to minimize risk.
*   **Data Management:**
    *   **Staging Database:** Can be a periodically restored (and sanitized) copy of production, or seeded with realistic test data.
    *   **Production Database:** Backed up regularly. Migrations applied carefully.
*   **Access Control:** Stricter access controls for production environments.
*   **Monitoring & Alerting:**
    *   Both environments should be monitored, but alerting thresholds and urgency will be higher for production.
*   **Third-Party Services:** Use sandbox/test accounts for third-party services in staging, and production accounts in production.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

*   **Tools:** [**Specify tools used, e.g., Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, Google Cloud Deployment Manager, Ansible, Pulumi.**]
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Version control for infrastructure.
    *   Repeatable and consistent environment provisioning.
    *   Automation of infrastructure changes.
    *   Disaster recovery.
*   **Process:** IaC scripts define the desired state of the infrastructure. The IaC tool then provisions or updates resources to match this state.
*   [**Link to IaC code/repository if applicable.**]

## Monitoring, Logging, and Alerting

*   **Logging:**
    *   Applications should produce structured logs (e.g., JSON).
    *   Centralized logging system (e.g., ELK Stack - Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana; Grafana Loki; Splunk; AWS CloudWatch Logs; Google Cloud Logging; Azure Monitor Logs).
*   **Monitoring:**
    *   Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana, Datadog, New Relic, Dynatrace, Sentry for error tracking).
    *   Infrastructure monitoring (CPU, memory, disk, network).
*   **Alerting:**
    *   Set up alerts for critical errors, performance degradation, security events, and resource exhaustion.
    *   Tools: Prometheus Alertmanager, Grafana Alerting, PagerDuty, Opsgenie, cloud provider alerting services.

By implementing these DevOps practices and CI/CD pipelines, the platform can achieve faster release cycles, higher quality, improved stability, and better collaboration across teams. This document should be updated as practices evolve.
