# System Architecture

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the autonomous coding agent platform's architecture, detailing its major components, their interactions, and the underlying design principles.

## High-Level Overview

[**Insert a high-level architectural diagram here. This diagram should depict the Frontend SPA, Backend Modular Monolith (with key modules like Auth, AI Workflow, Projects), Database, AI Integration Layer, and optional Message Queue, showing primary user and data flows.**]

The platform is designed as a **Modular Monolith** for the backend, built with Node.js and Express.js, providing a cohesive yet maintainable structure. Major domains like Authentication, AI Workflow Management, and Project Management are structured as isolated modules, potentially within a monorepo structure (e.g., managed by Nx or Turborepo). The frontend is a decoupled **Single Page Application (SPA)** built with React, interacting with the backend via a REST or GraphQL API.

The **AI Integration Layer** is a crucial plug-in module within the backend, responsible for interfacing with various AI models and services. This layer is designed with the potential to evolve into a separate microservice if future scalability demands it. For handling long-running or complex asynchronous AI tasks, the architecture supports **event-driven extensions** using technologies like Redis Streams or Kafka.

Key architectural characteristics include:
*   **Scalability:** Achieved through stateless backend APIs (leveraging JWTs for session management) allowing horizontal scaling, and optional asynchronous task processing via message queues.
*   **Modularity:** The backend's modular monolith design and the decoupled frontend promote separation of concerns and easier maintenance. The AI Integration Layer is also a distinct module.
*   **Maintainability:** Clear API contracts, consistent design principles, and the potential for domain-specific modules enhance maintainability.
*   **Extensibility:** Designed for adding new AI models, coding tools, and platform features through its modular structure and API-first approach.
*   **Security:** Prioritizes secure authentication (JWTs, OAuth2 for external IdPs), input validation, rate limiting, and structured audit logging.

## Core Components

The platform consists of the following major components:

### 1. Frontend Application (Client-Side SPA)
*   **Description:** The primary user interface for developers to interact with the autonomous coding agent, define tasks, manage projects, and view results.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Rendering user interfaces for code editing, task configuration, workflow building, and results display.
    *   Handling user input and client-side validation.
    *   Managing client-side state and asynchronous data fetching from the backend API.
    *   User authentication flows (login, signup, API key management UI).
    *   Displaying real-time updates via WebSockets or polling.
*   **Key Technologies:** React
*   **Key Sub-components & Libraries:**
    *   **State Management:** Zustand or Redux Toolkit (for scalable global state), React Query (for server state, caching, and optimistic updates).
    *   **UI Components & Styling:** Tailwind CSS (for utility-first styling and rapid UI development), Headless UI or Radix UI (for accessible, unstyled interactive component primitives).
    *   **Code Editor:** Monaco Editor (core editor of VS Code, embedded for a rich coding experience).
    *   **Routing:** React Router.
    *   **API Client:** Axios or Fetch API (integrated with React Query).
*   **Key Features Handled:**
    *   Code editor interface.
    *   Task configuration (prompts, input/output formats).
    *   Workflow builder (drag-drop or form-based UI for task chaining).
    *   Results panel for AI output, logs, and progress.
    *   User authentication, project dashboards, and API key management UI.

### 2. Backend API (Modular Monolith)
*   **Description:** The core engine of the platform, built with Node.js and Express.js. It handles business logic, orchestrates AI tasks, manages data, and exposes APIs.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Handling API requests from the frontend and external clients.
    *   User authentication and authorization (JWT issuance, API key control).
    *   Managing user projects, code snippets, and workflow definitions.
    *   Orchestrating code generation and other AI tasks via the Workflow Engine.
    *   Interfacing with AI models through the AI Service Proxy (AI Integration Layer).
    *   Logging telemetry data (requests, responses, errors).
    *   Sending real-time notifications to the frontend.
*   **Key Technologies:** Node.js, Express.js
*   **Key Modules/Services:**
    *   **AuthService:** Manages user login, signup, JWT issuance and refresh, API key generation and validation. Optionally integrates with OAuth2.0 providers like GitHub/GitLab for user authentication.
    *   **AIServiceProxy (AI Integration Layer Module):** Acts as a gateway to external AI APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.). Manages credentials, model selection, prompt templating, and basic response caching/deduplication. Handles synchronous requests and can dispatch tasks to a message queue for asynchronous processing.
    *   **WorkflowEngine:** Parses and executes defined AI workflows, orchestrating sequences of tasks and calls to the AIServiceProxy or other services.
    *   **ProjectManagementService:** Manages user projects, code files/snippets, and task/workflow histories.
    *   **TelemetryLogger:** Logs important system events, API requests/responses, and errors for monitoring and auditing.
    *   **NotificationService:** Facilitates real-time updates to the frontend, potentially using WebSockets or a polling fallback mechanism.
*   **ORM/Database Interaction:** Prisma (for type-safe database access to PostgreSQL).
*   **Authentication Strategy:** JWT with refresh tokens. API keys for programmatic access.

### 3. Database
*   **Description:** Persistent storage for all platform data, including user information, projects, code, AI workflow definitions, and operational logs.
*   **Responsibilities:** Storing and retrieving application data efficiently and reliably, ensuring data integrity.
*   **Key Technologies:** PostgreSQL
*   **Core Entities:**
    *   **User:** Stores authentication information (hashed passwords, OAuth identifiers), user preferences, API usage statistics, and links to API keys.
    *   **Project:** Belongs to a user, acts as a container for multiple tasks or workflows.
    *   **CodeSnippet:** Stores code files, generated content, or other textual artifacts related to tasks.
    *   **AIWorkflow:** Defines the steps, configurations (prompts, model choices), and parameters for each autonomous coding task.
    *   **WorkflowRun:** Captures metadata for each execution instance of an AIWorkflow, including status, inputs, outputs (or references to them), logs, and timestamps.
    *   **APIKey:** Linked to a User, with potential rate limits or scope restrictions.
    *   **(Optional but Recommended):** `Logs` (for detailed operational/error logging), `AuditTrails` (for tracking significant actions), `PromptsHistory` (for versioning and analysis of prompts used).

### 4. AI Integration Layer (Internal Backend Module)
*   **Description:** A dedicated module within the backend responsible for all communications with external AI models and services.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Managing API credentials for various AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, etc.) securely.
    *   Implementing logic for selecting the appropriate AI model based on task requirements or user configuration.
    *   Handling prompt templating, validation, and potential pre-processing before sending to AI APIs.
    *   Parsing and standardizing responses from different AI models.
    *   Implementing caching strategies for AI responses where appropriate to reduce latency and cost.
    *   Tracking token usage and costs associated with AI API calls.
*   **Interaction Style:**
    *   **Synchronous:** For short-lived AI tasks (e.g., quick code completion, simple analysis), makes direct REST calls to AI APIs and awaits the response.
    *   **Asynchronous:** For long-running AI tasks (e.g., generating large codebases, complex chain-of-thought processes), it can dispatch a job to the Message Queue and provide a job ID for polling or later notification.

### 5. Message Queue / Event Bus (Optional, for Scalability and Asynchronous Tasks)
*   **Description:** Facilitates asynchronous processing of long-running AI tasks, decoupling task submission from execution.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Queuing AI jobs submitted by the WorkflowEngine or AIServiceProxy.
    *   Allowing dedicated worker services to consume and process these jobs independently.
    *   Ensuring reliable task execution and enabling retries.
*   **Use Case Example:** For complex code generation tasks or "chain-of-thought" AI processes that might take significant time, preventing API timeouts and improving responsiveness.
*   **Technology Options:**
    *   **Redis Streams:** Lightweight option for simpler task queuing.
    *   **BullMQ (Node.js) or Temporal:** More robust job orchestration frameworks with features like delayed jobs, retries, and progress tracking.
    *   **Apache Kafka:** Suitable for very high-throughput event streaming if the platform scales to handle a massive number of concurrent AI tasks (potentially overkill for initial stages).

## Component Interactions

### Typical Autonomous Coding Task Flow:
1.  **Frontend (React SPA):** User defines a coding task (e.g., writes a prompt, provides existing code, configures parameters) via the Monaco Editor and workflow UI. Submits the task.
2.  **Backend API (Node.js/Express.js):**
    *   The request hits an API Gateway (if used) or directly the backend controller.
    *   `AuthService` validates the JWT or API Key.
3.  **WorkflowEngine:**
    *   Receives the task definition.
    *   Parses the workflow steps (which might involve one or more AI calls, data manipulation, etc.).
    *   For each AI-related step, it dispatches the task to the `AIServiceProxy` (AI Integration Layer).
4.  **AIServiceProxy (AI Integration Layer):**
    *   Selects the appropriate AI model (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) based on configuration or task type.
    *   Formats the prompt using its templating engine.
    *   Sends the request to the chosen external AI API.
    *   For synchronous tasks, awaits the response. For asynchronous tasks, it might place a job onto the Message Queue and return a job ID.
5.  **Result Processing & Storage:**
    *   The `WorkflowEngine` or a dedicated worker (if async) receives the AI's output.
    *   The result (e.g., generated code, analysis) is processed.
    *   A `WorkflowRun` record is created/updated in the PostgreSQL database with metadata, status, and the output (or a reference to it, e.g., in `CodeSnippet`).
6.  **Frontend Notification:**
    *   **Polling:** The frontend might poll an endpoint for the status of the `WorkflowRun` using its ID.
    *   **WebSockets:** The `NotificationService` on the backend can push a real-time update to the connected frontend client upon task completion or status change.

### Authentication Flow:
1.  **Frontend:** User submits login credentials (email/password) or initiates an OAuth flow (e.g., "Login with GitHub").
2.  **Backend API (`AuthService`):**
    *   **Credentials:** Verifies email/password against the `User` table in PostgreSQL (hashed passwords).
    *   **OAuth:** Handles the OAuth callback, exchanges the authorization code for tokens from the IdP, and fetches user profile information. Creates or links the platform user account.
    *   Upon successful authentication, generates a short-lived JWT (access token) and a long-lived refresh token.
3.  **Frontend:** Securely stores the JWT and refresh token (e.g., access token in memory, refresh token in an HttpOnly cookie or secure storage).
4.  **Subsequent Requests:** Frontend includes the JWT in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for all protected API routes.
5.  **Backend API (Middleware):** Middleware on protected routes verifies the JWT's signature and expiration. If valid, it extracts user information and attaches it to the request object for use by controllers and services. If expired, the frontend uses the refresh token to obtain a new JWT from the `AuthService`.

## Data Models and Storage

Key data entities stored in PostgreSQL include:
*   **User:** Authentication details, preferences, API usage.
*   **Project:** User-owned container for workflows and code.
*   **CodeSnippet:** Stores code files, generated content.
*   **AIWorkflow:** Definitions of task steps and configurations.
*   **WorkflowRun:** Metadata and results of each workflow execution.
*   **APIKey:** User-generated keys for programmatic access.
*   **(Optional):** `Logs`, `AuditTrails`, `PromptsHistory`.

## Design Principles
*   **Modular Monolith:** Promotes cohesive code within the backend, with clearly defined domain modules for better maintainability and the option for gradual decoupling into microservices if specific modules require independent scaling or different technology stacks in the future.
*   **Stateless Backend APIs:** Backend services are designed to be stateless where possible, relying on JWTs for client sessions. This supports easier horizontal scaling.
*   **Event-Driven for Long AI Tasks:** Utilize a message queue-based pattern for long-running AI tasks to avoid blocking API requests, improve system resilience, and enable more complex asynchronous workflows.
*   **API First:** All core functionalities and services are exposed via clean, well-defined REST (or potentially GraphQL) APIs, with OpenAPI/Swagger definitions for clear contracts.
*   **Security First:** Implement robust input validation, output encoding, rate limiting on APIs, secure management of credentials, and structured audit logging for security-sensitive operations.
*   **DevOps Friendly & Iterative Development:** Emphasize CI/CD practices, comprehensive automated testing (unit, integration, E2E), containerization with Docker, and version-tagged releases to support rapid iteration and reliable deployments.
