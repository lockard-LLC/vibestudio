# Third-Party Tool Integration

This section provides step-by-step guides and best practices for integrating various third-party tools and services with the Autonomous Coding Agent platform. Effective integration can significantly enhance the platform's capabilities, automate workflows (e.g., linking AI coding tasks to project management tools), and improve developer productivity.

## General Principles for Integration

Before diving into specific tools, consider these general principles applicable to our Node.js backend and React frontend:

1.  **Authentication:**
    *   **OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Code Grant):** Preferred for services that support it (e.g., Google, Slack, GitHub, Jira Cloud). Your Node.js backend will handle the OAuth flow, storing tokens securely (refresh tokens encrypted in PostgreSQL). The React frontend will initiate the flow and handle callbacks.
    *   **API Keys/Tokens:** For services using simpler token-based auth. Keys should be configurable by users/admins in your platform and stored encrypted in the backend. The Node.js backend will make API calls using these keys.
    *   **Service Accounts (for Google Cloud, AWS, etc.):** If your platform needs to interact with cloud services programmatically as itself (not on behalf of a user), use service accounts with securely managed credentials.

2.  **Configuration (Platform Side):**
    *   The React frontend should provide a settings UI for users/admins to initiate OAuth connections or input API keys/tokens and other integration-specific settings.
    *   These configurations are sent to the Node.js backend and stored securely in the PostgreSQL database (e.g., in a dedicated `integrations_config` table or associated with user/project settings).

3.  **Data Handling & Security:**
    *   Clearly define data schemas for exchange.
    *   The Node.js backend should implement robust error handling, retry mechanisms (e.g., with exponential backoff for API calls), and respect rate limits of third-party APIs.
    *   Adhere to data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). Be transparent about what data is shared with third-party services.
    *   Validate and sanitize any data coming from third-party systems.

4.  **User Experience (Frontend):**
    *   Make the connection process intuitive (e.g., "Connect to Slack" button).
    *   Provide clear feedback on integration status (connected, disconnected, errors) in the React UI.
    *   Visually distinguish features or data that originate from integrated services.

5.  **Modularity (Backend):**
    *   Each third-party integration should ideally be a distinct module within the Node.js backend (see [Feature Extension Guide](../02-feature-extension.md)). This includes its own services, routes (if needed for callbacks), and configuration logic.

6.  **Webhooks:**
    *   If your platform needs to receive real-time notifications from third-party services (e.g., Jira issue update, Slack message), the Node.js backend will expose secure HTTPS endpoints.
    *   Implement signature verification for webhooks if the third-party service provides it (e.g., Slack, GitHub). Store webhook secrets securely.

7.  **Logging and Monitoring:**
    *   The Node.js backend should log key integration events: successful connections, API calls made, data synced, errors encountered. This aids in troubleshooting and monitoring integration health.

## Specific Tool Integration Guides

The following sub-sections provide detailed integration instructions for various tools relevant to an autonomous coding agent platform. Each guide typically covers:

*   Overview of the service and how it can benefit the platform.
*   Prerequisites (developer accounts, application setup on the third-party service).
*   Authentication method(s) with examples for the Node.js backend.
*   Key API endpoints or SDK usage.
*   Step-by-step integration process, including frontend (React) considerations for initiating connections and backend (Node.js) logic for handling API calls and data.
*   Webhook handling (if applicable).
*   Security best practices and troubleshooting tips.

### Available Integration Guides:

1.  **[Google Services](./05-a-google-services.md)**
    *   **Gmail API:** (e.g., for sending notifications about coding tasks, reading email instructions if permitted).
    *   **Google Calendar API:** (e.g., scheduling coding tasks, syncing deadlines).
    *   **Google Drive API:** (e.g., accessing code files or project documents stored in Drive).
2.  **[Slack](./05-b-slack.md)**
    *   Sending notifications about AI task progress or completion to Slack channels.
    *   Building a Slack bot for users to trigger coding tasks or query status from Slack.
    *   Handling Slack slash commands.
3.  **[Discord](./05-c-discord.md)**
    *   Similar to Slack: notifications, bot commands for interacting with the coding agent.
4.  **[Jira and Atlassian Suite](./05-d-jira-atlassian.md)**
    *   Creating Jira issues automatically from AI-identified bugs or new feature suggestions.
    *   Updating Jira issues with progress from coding tasks.
    *   Linking platform tasks/workflows to Jira issues.
5.  **[Custom Enterprise Tools / Proprietary AI Modules](./05-e-custom-enterprise-tools.md)**
    *   General guidelines for integrating with internal systems or specialized third-party AI modules that might have custom APIs.
    *   Focus on API contract definition, authentication patterns (e.g., internal token systems), and data mapping.
6.  **(Coming Soon) Git Providers (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket):**
    *   Authenticating users via their Git provider accounts.
    *   Accessing repositories to read code for analysis or modification by the AI agent.
    *   Committing AI-generated code changes back to repositories (requires careful permission handling).
    *   Handling webhooks for repository events (e.g., new commit, PR created).
