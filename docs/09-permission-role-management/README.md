# Permission & Role Management

This guide outlines how user roles and permissions are managed within the platform, and importantly, how they can be extended when new modules, features, or integrations are added. A robust and flexible permission system is key to maintaining security and providing granular access control.

## Overview

The platform employs a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. Key concepts:
*   **Users:** Individuals who interact with the platform.
*   **Permissions (or Actions/Operations):** Specific actions a user can perform on a resource (e.g., `read:document`, `create:task`, `delete:user`, `manage:billing_settings`).
*   **Resources:** Entities within the platform that actions can be performed upon (e.g., a document, a task, a user account, a project).
*   **Roles:** Collections of permissions. Users are assigned one or more roles, and they inherit the permissions associated with those roles. (e.g., `Administrator`, `Editor`, `Viewer`, `ProjectManager`).

## Core Permission System Design

[**Describe the platform's specific RBAC implementation. Consider these aspects:**]

*   **Permission Definition:**
    *   How are permissions defined? (e.g., string-based like `feature_x:action_y:resource_z`, predefined enums, bitmasks).
    *   Are they hardcoded, database-driven, or configuration file-driven?
    *   **Convention:** A common convention is `[verb]:[resource_type]` or `[module]:[verb]:[resource_type]` (e.g., `posts:create`, `users:edit`, `billing:manage_subscription`).
*   **Role Definition:**
    *   How are roles defined and associated with permissions? (e.g., a `roles` table and a `role_permissions` join table in the database).
*   **User-Role Assignment:**
    *   How are users assigned roles? (e.g., a `user_roles` join table). Can a user have multiple roles?
*   **Checking Permissions:**
    *   How does the application check if a user has a specific permission for a given resource?
    *   Is this done via a central authorization service/middleware, or checked ad-hoc in controllers/services?
    *   **Example Check (Conceptual):** `currentUser.hasPermission('create:task', { projectId: 123 })` or `can(currentUser, 'create', taskResource)`.
*   **Resource Ownership/Context:**
    *   Does the permission system consider resource ownership or context? (e.g., an `Editor` can only edit *their own* posts, or posts within a project they belong to). This often requires more complex attribute-based access control (ABAC) logic in addition to RBAC.

## Default Roles and Permissions

[**List the out-of-the-box roles provided by the platform and a summary of their key permissions. This will be highly specific to your platform.**]

**Example Default Roles:**

*   **Super Administrator (`superadmin`):**
    *   Has all permissions across the entire platform.
    *   Can manage system settings, users, roles, and all data.
    *   Typically very few users have this role.
*   **Administrator (`admin`):**
    *   Manages users, content, and specific operational aspects within their scope (e.g., a specific tenant or organization if multi-tenant).
    *   Cannot typically change fundamental system configurations like a superadmin.
    *   Permissions might include: `users:create`, `users:edit`, `users:delete`, `content:manage_all`, `settings:edit_module_x`.
*   **Editor (`editor`):**
    *   Can create, edit, and delete content they own or have explicit permission for.
    *   Permissions might include: `posts:create`, `posts:edit_own`, `posts:delete_own`, `media:upload`.
*   **Contributor (`contributor`):**
    *   Can create content but may require approval before it's published. Cannot typically edit or delete others' content.
    *   Permissions might include: `posts:create_draft`, `posts:edit_own_draft`.
*   **Viewer (`viewer` or `member`):**
    *   Read-only access to most content.
    *   Permissions might include: `posts:read`, `comments:read`.
*   **Guest (`guest`):**
    *   Very limited access, often for unauthenticated users or users with minimal privileges.

## Extending Roles and Permissions for New Modules/Integrations

When a new module, feature, or third-party integration is added to the platform, it often introduces new resources and actions that need to be governed by the permission system.

### 1. Identifying New Permissions:
*   For each new feature or module:
    *   List all new actions users can perform (e.g., `module_x:create_widget`, `module_x:view_report`, `integration_y:sync_data`).
    *   List all new resources these actions apply to (e.g., `widget`, `report`, `synced_data_record`).
*   Define these new permissions following the platform's established naming convention.

### 2. Registering New Permissions with the System:
*   [**Describe the mechanism for adding new permissions.**]
    *   **Database-Driven:**
        *   Add new permission strings/records to a `permissions` table.
        *   This might be done via:
            *   A migration script when the module is installed/enabled.
            *   An admin UI for managing permissions.
    *   **Code-Based / Configuration File:**
        *   If permissions are defined in code (e.g., enums, constants) or a central configuration file, the new module's permissions need to be added there.
        *   The module itself might provide a list of permissions it introduces during its initialization phase.

**Example: Module Initialization Registering Permissions (Conceptual)**
```javascript
// In my-new-module/init.js
// platform.permissions.register([
//   { name: 'my_module:create_item', description: 'Allows creating new items in My Module.' },
//   { name: 'my_module:view_item_details', description: 'Allows viewing detailed information of items in My Module.' },
//   { name: 'my_module:configure_settings', description: 'Allows configuring settings for My Module.' }
// ]);
```

### 3. Assigning New Permissions to Existing or New Roles:
Once new permissions are registered, they need to be assigned to roles.
*   **Default Assignment:**
    *   The module developer should decide which default roles should initially get these new permissions.
    *   For example, `my_module:configure_settings` might be given to `Administrator` roles by default.
    *   `my_module:create_item` might be given to `Editor` roles.
    *   This can be done programmatically during module installation/activation or documented for manual admin configuration.
*   **Admin UI for Role Management:**
    *   The platform should provide an administrative interface where users with appropriate privileges (e.g., Super Administrators) can:
        *   View all available permissions (including newly registered ones).
        *   Create new custom roles.
        *   Edit existing roles by adding or removing permissions.
        *   Assign roles to users.

**Example Admin UI Flow:**
1.  Admin navigates to "Roles & Permissions".
2.  Selects an existing role (e.g., "Editor") or creates a new role (e.g., "My Module Manager").
3.  Sees a list of all available permissions, categorized by module or resource.
4.  Checks/unchecks the new permissions (e.g., `my_module:create_item`, `my_module:view_item_details`) for that role.
5.  Saves the role changes.

### 4. Enforcing New Permissions in Module Code:
The new module's code must use the platform's authorization mechanism to check for these new permissions before allowing actions.

**Example (Conceptual in a module's controller/service):**
```javascript
// my-new-module/controllers/itemController.js
// async function createItem(req, res) {
//   const currentUser = req.user; // Assuming user object is available
//   const data = req.body;

//   // Check permission before proceeding
//   if (!platform.authorization.hasPermission(currentUser, 'my_module:create_item', { someContext: data.contextId })) {
//     return res.status(403).send('Forbidden: You do not have permission to create items in this module.');
//   }

//   // Proceed with creating the item
//   const newItem = await itemService.create(data, currentUser);
//   res.status(201).json(newItem);
// }
```

### 5. Handling Permissions Related to Third-Party Integrations:
*   When integrating a third-party tool (e.g., Slack, Jira), you might need platform-side permissions to control:
    *   Who can configure the integration (e.g., `integration_slack:manage_settings`).
    *   Who can use features powered by the integration (e.g., `integration_jira:create_issue_from_platform`).
    *   Who can view data fetched from the third party (e.g., `integration_google_calendar:view_events`).
*   These permissions are defined and managed within your platform just like any other module-specific permission.
*   The actual access to the third-party service is still governed by the OAuth tokens or API keys used for that integration, which have their own scopes/permissions on the third-party side. Your platform's permissions act as an additional layer of control *within your platform*.

## Best Practices for Extensible Permission Management

*   **Granularity:** Define permissions at a reasonably granular level to allow for flexible role configuration. Avoid overly broad permissions.
*   **Clear Naming Conventions:** Use consistent and understandable names for permissions and roles.
*   **Default Sensible Roles:** Provide a good set of default roles that cover common use cases.
*   **Admin UI:** A user-friendly admin interface for managing roles and permissions is crucial for non-developer administrators.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Document all default roles and their permissions.
    *   When a module developer adds new permissions, they must document them, including what they control and suggested role assignments.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** The core permission checking logic should be centralized if possible, making it easier for module developers to use.
*   **Auditing:** Log changes to roles and permissions assignments for security and troubleshooting.
*   **Testing:** Thoroughly test permission enforcement for all roles and new modules.

## Future Considerations (Advanced)

*   **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** For more complex scenarios, ABAC allows defining policies based on attributes of the user, resource, and environment (e.g., "a user can edit a document if they are in the same department as the document owner AND the document status is 'draft'"). This can complement RBAC.
*   **Permission Inheritance:** Hierarchical roles where child roles inherit permissions from parent roles.
*   **Temporary Permissions/Delegation:** Allowing users to temporarily delegate some of their permissions to another user.
*   **Tenant-Specific Roles (for Multi-Tenant Platforms):** If your platform is multi-tenant, roles and permissions might need to be scoped per tenant, allowing tenant administrators to define their own custom roles within their tenant.

By designing an extensible permission system and providing clear guidelines for module developers, your platform can maintain robust security while adapting to new features and integrations. Administrators will have the tools they need to tailor access control to their specific organizational requirements.
