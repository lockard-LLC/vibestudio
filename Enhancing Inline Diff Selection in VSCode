The issue at hand is the inability to select text from deleted lines in the inline diff view of Visual Studio Code (VSCode) version 1.3.0-insider on OS X 10.11. Users can select deleted lines in the side-by-side view, but not in the inline mode, which hampers the ability to restore or revert small pieces of code.
