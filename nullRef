Feature Request:

I would like to propose a new feature for Visual Studio Code: an **AI-Augmented Debugging Assistant** specifically focused on handling `NullReferenceException` (and similar null dereference) runtime errors.

Motivation:

NullReferenceExceptions are one of the most common and time-consuming issues in programming, especially in languages like C# and JavaScript/TypeScript. While static analysis helps prevent some of these, many null errors only become evident during runtime.

Feature Overview:

When a NullReferenceException occurs:
- VS Code should capture the runtime context (error type, stack trace, variable values).
- A side panel or tooltip should:
  - Explain the error in plain English.
  - Trace the origin of the null value.
  - Suggest intelligent fixes (e.g., null checks, default values, conditional guards).
- Optionally, integrate with an AI model (e.g., GPT via API) to generate code snippets for fixes or explain the error further.

Potential Impact:

- Speeds up debugging by offering contextual explanations and suggestions.
- Helps beginner/intermediate developers understand and fix null-related bugs quickly.
- Makes VS Code a more intelligent and developer-friendly IDE.

Implementation Ideas:

- Utilize the built-in debugger API to hook into runtime exceptions.
- Use Tree-sitter or TypeScript services to extract code context.
- Optionally leverage AI APIs (OpenAI, Hugging Face) for explanation and fix generation.

I'd love to contribute or collaborate on a proof of concept for this!

Thank you for considering this feature
