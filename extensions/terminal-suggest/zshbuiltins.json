In this introductory section,\n       `o\bop\bpt\bti\bio\bon\bn' always has the meaning of an option to a command that should\n       be familiar to most command line users.\n\n       Typically, options are single letters preceded by a hyphen (-\b-).\n       Options that take an argument accept it either immediately following\n       the option letter or after white space, for example `p\bpr\bri\bin\bnt\bt -\b-C\bC3\b3 {\b{1\b1.\b..\b.9\b9}\b}'\n       or `p\bpr\bri\bin\bnt\bt -\b-C\bC 3\b3 {\b{1\b1.\b..\b.9\b9}\b}' are equivalent.  Arguments to options are not\n       the same as arguments to the command; the documentation indicates which\n       is which.  Options that do not take an argument may be combined in a\n       single word, for example `p\bpr\bri\bin\bnt\bt -\b-r\brc\bca\ba -\b--\b- *\b*' and `p\bpr\bri\bin\bnt\bt -\b-r\br -\b-c\bc -\b-a\ba -\b--\b- *\b*'\n       are equivalent.\n\n       Some shell builtin commands also take options that begin with `+\b+'\n       instead of `-\b-'.  The list below makes clear which commands these are.\n\n       Options (together with their individual arguments, if any) must appear\n       in a group before any non-option arguments; once the first non-option\n       argument has been found, option processing is terminated.\n\n       All builtin commands other than `e\bec\bch\bho\bo' and precommand modifiers, even\n       those that have no options, can be given the argument `-\b--\b-' to terminate\n       option processing.  This indicates that the following words are\n       non-option arguments, but is otherwise ignored.  This is useful in\n       cases where arguments to the command may begin with `-\b-'.  For\n       historical reasons, most builtin commands (including `e\bec\bch\bho\bo') also\n       recognize a single `-\b-' in a separate word for this purpose; note that\n       this is less standard and use of `-\b--\b-' is recommended.\n\n       -\b- _\bs_\bi_\bm_\bp_\bl_\be _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd\n              See the section `Precommand Modifiers' in _\bz_\bs_\bh_\bm_\bi_\bs_\bc(1).\n\n       .\b. _\bf_\bi_\bl_\be [ _\ba_\br_\bg ... ]\n              Read commands from _\bf_\bi_\bl_\be and execute them in the current shell\n              environment.\n\n              If _\bf_\bi_\bl_\be does not contain a slash, or if P\bPA\bAT\bTH\bH_\b_D\bDI\bIR\bRS\bS is set, the\n              shell looks in the components of $\b$p\bpa\bat\bth\bh to find the directory\n              containing _\bf_\bi_\bl_\be.  Files in the current directory are not read\n              unless `.\b.' appears somewhere in $\b$p\bpa\bat\bth\bh.  If a file named\n              `_\bf_\bi_\bl_\be.\b.z\bzw\bwc\bc' is found, is newer than _\bf_\bi_\bl_\be, and is the compiled\n              form (created with the z\bzc\bco\bom\bmp\bpi\bil\ble\be builtin) of _\bf_\bi_\bl_\be, then commands\n              are read from that file instead of _\bf_\bi_\bl_\be.\n\n              If any arguments _\ba_\br_\bg are given, they become the positional\n              parameters; the old positional parameters are restored when the\n              _\bf_\bi_\bl_\be is done executing.  However, if no arguments are given, the\n              positional parameters remain those of the calling context, and\n              no restoring is done.\n\n              If _\bf_\bi_\bl_\be was not found the return status is 127; if _\bf_\bi_\bl_\be was\n              found but contained a syntax error the return status is 126;\n              else the return status is the exit status of the last command\n              executed.\n\n       :\b: [ _\ba_\br_\bg ... ]\n              This command does nothing, although normal argument expansions\n              is performed which may have effects on shell parameters.  A zero\n              exit status is returned.\n\n       a\bal\bli\bia\bas\bs [ {+\b+|-\b-}g\bgm\bmr\brs\bsL\bL ] [ _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be[=\b=_\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be] ... ]\n              For each _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be with a corresponding _\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be, define an alias with\n              that value.  A trailing space in _\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be causes the next word to\n              be checked for alias expansion.  If the -\b-g\bg flag is present,\n              define a global alias; global aliases are expanded even if they\n              do not occur in command position:\n\n                     %\b% p\bpe\ber\brl\bld\bdo\boc\bc -\b--\b-h\bhe\bel\blp\bp 2\b2>\b>&\b&1\b1 |\b| g\bgr\bre\bep\bp '\b'b\bbu\bui\bil\blt\bt-\b-i\bin\bn f\bfu\bun\bnc\bct\bti\bio\bon\bns\bs'\b'\n                         -\b-f\bf   S\bSe\bea\bar\brc\bch\bh P\bPe\ber\brl\bl b\bbu\bui\bil\blt\bt-\b-i\bin\bn f\bfu\bun\bnc\bct\bti\bio\bon\bns\bs\n                     %\b% a\bal\bli\bia\bas\bs -\b-g\bg H\bHG\bG=\b='\b'-\b--\b-h\bhe\bel\blp\bp 2\b2>\b>&\b&1\b1 |\b| g\bgr\bre\bep\bp'\b'\n                     %\b% p\bpe\ber\brl\bld\bdo\boc\bc H\bHG\bG '\b'b\bbu\bui\bil\blt\bt-\b-i\bin\bn f\bfu\bun\bnc\bct\bti\bio\bon\bns\bs'\b'\n                         -\b-f\bf   S\bSe\bea\bar\brc\bch\bh P\bPe\ber\brl\bl b\bbu\bui\bil\blt\bt-\b-i\bin\bn f\bfu\bun\bnc\bct\bti\bio\bon\bns\bs\n\n              If the -\b-s\bs flag is present, define a suffix alias: if the command\n              word on a command line is in the form `_\bt_\be_\bx_\bt.\b._\bn_\ba_\bm_\be', where _\bt_\be_\bx_\bt is\n              any non-empty string, it is replaced by the text `_\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be\n              _\bt_\be_\bx_\bt.\b._\bn_\ba_\bm_\be'.  Note that _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be is treated as a literal string, not\n              a pattern.  A trailing space in _\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be is not special in this\n              case.  For example,\n\n                     a\bal\bli\bia\bas\bs -\b-s\bs p\bps\bs=\b='\b'g\bgv\bv -\b--\b-'\b'\n\n              will cause the command `*\b*.\b.p\bps\bs' to be expanded to `g\bgv\bv -\b--\b- *\b*.\b.p\bps\bs'.\n              As alias expansion is carried out earlier than globbing, the\n              `*\b*.\b.p\bps\bs' will then be expanded.  Suffix aliases constitute a\n              different name space from other aliases (so in the above example\n              it is still possible to create an alias for the command p\bps\bs) and\n              the two sets are never listed together.\n\n              For each _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be with no _\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be, print the value of _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be, if any.\n              With no arguments, print all currently defined aliases other\n              than suffix aliases.  If the -\b-m\bm flag is given the arguments are\n              taken as patterns (they should be quoted to preserve them from\n              being interpreted as glob patterns), and the aliases matching\n              these patterns are printed.  When printing aliases and one of\n              the -\b-g\bg, -\b-r\br or -\b-s\bs flags is present, restrict the printing to\n              global, regular or suffix aliases, respectively; a regular alias\n              is one which is neither a global nor a suffix alias.   Using `+\b+'\n              instead of `-\b-', or ending the option list with a single `+\b+',\n              prevents the values of the aliases from being printed.\n\n              If the -\b-L\bL flag is present, then print each alias in a manner\n              suitable for putting in a startup script.  The exit status is\n              nonzero if a _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be (with no _\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be) is given for which no alias\n              has been defined.\n\n              For more on aliases, include common problems, see the section\n              ALIASING in _\bz_\bs_\bh_\bm_\bi_\bs_\bc(1).\n\n       a\bau\but\bto\bol\blo\boa\bad\bd [ {+\b+|-\b-}R\bRT\bTU\bUX\bXd\bdk\bkm\bmr\brt\btW\bWz\bz ] [ -\b-w\bw ] [ _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be ... ]\n              See the section `Autoloading Functions' in _\bz_\bs_\bh_\bm_\bi_\bs_\bc(1) for full\n              details.  The f\bfp\bpa\bat\bth\bh parameter will be searched to find the\n              function definition when the function is first referenced.\n\n              If _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be consists of an absolute path, the function is defined to\n              load from the file given (searching as usual for dump files in\n              the given location).  The name of the function is the basename\n              (non-directory part) of the file.  It is normally an error if\n              the function is not found in the given location; however, if the\n              option -\b-d\bd is given, searching for the function defaults to\n              $\b$f\bfp\bpa\bat\bth\bh.  If a function is loaded by absolute path, any functions\n              loaded from it that are marked for a\bau\but\bto\bol\blo\boa\bad\bd without an absolute\n              path have the load path of the parent function temporarily\n              prepended to $\b$f\bfp\bpa\bat\bth\bh.\n\n              If the option -\b-r\br or -\b-R\bR is given, the function is searched for\n              immediately and the location is recorded internally for use when\n              the function is executed; a relative path is expanded using the\n              value of $\b$P\bPW\bWD\bD.  This protects against a change to $\b$f\bfp\bpa\bat\bth\bh after\n              the call to a\bau\but\bto\bol\blo\boa\bad\bd.  With -\b-r\br, if the function is not found, it\n              is silently left unresolved until execution; with -\b-R\bR, an error\n              message is printed and command processing aborted immediately\n              the search fails, i.e. at the a\bau\but\bto\bol\blo\boa\bad\bd command rather than at\n              function execution..\n\n              The flag -\b-X\bX may be used only inside a shell function.  It causes\n              the calling function to be marked for autoloading and then\n              immediately loaded and executed, with the current array of\n              positional parameters as arguments.  This replaces the previous\n              definition of the function.  If no function definition is found,\n              an error is printed and the function remains undefined and\n              marked for autoloading.  If an argument is given, it is used as\n              a directory (i.e. it does not include the name of the function)\n              in which the function is to be found; this may be combined with\n              the -\b-d\bd option to allow the function search to default to $\b$f\bfp\bpa\bat\bth\bh\n              if it is not in the given location.\n\n              The flag +\b+X\bX attempts to load each _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be as an autoloaded\n              function, but does _\bn_\bo_\bt execute it.  The exit status is zero\n              (success) if the function was not previously defined _\ba_\bn_\bd a\n              definition for it was found.  This does _\bn_\bo_\bt replace any existing\n              definition of the function.  The exit status is nonzero\n              (failure) if the function was already defined or when no\n              definition was found.  In the latter case the function remains\n              undefined and marked for autoloading.  If ksh-style autoloading\n              is enabled, the function created will contain the contents of\n              the file plus a call to the function itself appended to it, thus\n              giving normal ksh autoloading behaviour on the first call to the\n              function.  If the -\b-m\bm flag is also given each _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be is treated as\n              a pattern and all functions already marked for autoload that\n              match the pattern are loaded.\n\n              With the -\b-t\bt flag, turn on execution tracing; with -\b-T\bT, turn on\n              execution tracing only for the current function, turning it off\n              on entry to any called functions that do not also have tracing\n              enabled.\n\n              With the -\b-U\bU flag, alias expansion is suppressed when the\n              function is loaded.\n\n              With the -\b-w\bw flag, the _\bn_\ba_\bm_\bes are taken as names of files compiled\n              with the z\bzc\bco\bom\bmp\bpi\bil\ble\be builtin, and all functions defined in them are\n              marked for autoloading.\n\n              The flags -\b-z\bz and -\b-k\bk mark the function to be autoloaded using the\n              zsh or ksh style, as if the option K\bKS\bSH\bH_\b_A\bAU\bUT\bTO\bOL\bLO\bOA\bAD\bD were unset or\n              were set, respectively.  The flags override the setting of the\n              option at the time the function is loaded.\n\n              Note that the a\bau\but\bto\bol\blo\boa\bad\bd command makes no attempt to ensure the\n              shell options set during the loading or execution of the file\n              have any particular value.  For this, the e\bem\bmu\bul\bla\bat\bte\be command can be\n              used:\n\n                     e\bem\bmu\bul\bla\bat\bte\be z\bzs\bsh\bh -\b-c\bc '\b'a\bau\but\bto\bol\blo\boa\bad\bd -\b-U\bUz\bz _\bf_\bu_\bn_\bc'\b'\n\n              arranges that when _\bf_\bu_\bn_\bc is loaded the shell is in native z\bzs\bsh\bh\n              emulation, and this emulation is also applied when _\bf_\bu_\bn_\bc is run.\n\n              Some of the functions of a\bau\but\bto\bol\blo\boa\bad\bd are also provided by f\bfu\bun\bnc\bct\bti\bio\bon\bns\bs\n              -\b-u\bu or f\bfu\bun\bnc\bct\bti\bio\bon\bns\bs -\b-U\bU, but a\bau\but\bto\bol\blo\boa\bad\bd is a more comprehensive\n              interface.\n\n       b\bbg\bg [ _\bj_\bo_\bb ... ]\n       _\bj_\bo_\bb ... &\b&\n              Put each specified _\bj_\bo_\bb in the background, or the current job if\n              none is specified.\n\n       b\bbi\bin\bnd\bdk\bke\bey\by\n              See the section `Zle Builtins' in _\bz_\bs_\bh_\bz_\bl_\be(1).\n\n       b\bbr\bre\bea\bak\bk [ _\bn ]\n              Exit from an enclosing f\bfo\bor\br, w\bwh\bhi\bil\ble\be, u\bun\bnt\bti\bil\bl, s\bse\bel\ble\bec\bct\bt or r\bre\bep\bpe\bea\bat\bt loop.\n              If an arithmetic expression _\bn is specified, then break _\bn levels\n              instead of just one.\n\n       b\bbu\bui\bil\blt\bti\bin\bn _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be [ _\ba_\br_\bg_\bs ... ]\n              Executes the builtin _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be, with the given _\ba_\br_\bg_\bs.\n\n       b\bby\bye\be    Same as e\bex\bxi\bit\bt.\n\n       c\bca\bap\bp    See the section `The zsh/cap Module' in _\bz_\bs_\bh_\bm_\bo_\bd_\bu_\bl_\be_\bs(1).\n\n       c\bcd\bd [ -\b-q\bqs\bsL\bLP\bP ] [ _\ba_\br_\bg ]\n       c\bcd\bd [ -\b-q\bqs\bsL\bLP\bP ] _\bo_\bl_\bd _\bn_\be_\bw\n       c\bcd\bd [ -\b-q\bqs\bsL\bLP\bP ] {+\b+|-\b-}_\bn\n              Change the current directory.

If _\ba_\br_\bg is `-\b-', change to the previous directory.\n\n              Otherwise, if _\ba_\br_\bg begins with a slash, attempt to change to the\n              directory given by _\ba_\br_\bg.\n\n              If _\ba_\br_\bg does not begin with a slash, the behaviour depends on\n              whether the current directory `.\b.' occurs in the list of\n              directories contained in the shell parameter c\bcd\bdp\bpa\bat\bth\bh.  If it does\n              not, first attempt to change to the directory _\ba_\br_\bg under the\n              current directory, and if that fails but c\bcd\bdp\bpa\bat\bth\bh is set and\n              contains at least one element attempt to change to the directory\n              _\ba_\br_\bg under each component of c\bcd\bdp\bpa\bat\bth\bh in turn until successful.  If\n              `.\b.' occurs in c\bcd\bdp\bpa\bat\bth\bh, then c\bcd\bdp\bpa\bat\bth\bh is searched strictly in order\n              so that `.\b.' is only tried at the appropriate point.\n\n              The order of testing c\bcd\bdp\bpa\bat\bth\bh is modified if the option P\bPO\bOS\bSI\bIX\bX_\b_C\bCD\bD\n              is set, as described in the documentation for the option.\n\n              If no directory is found, the option C\bCD\bDA\bAB\bBL\bLE\bE_\b_V\bVA\bAR\bRS\bS is set, and a\n              parameter named _\ba_\br_\bg exists whose value begins with a slash,\n              treat its value as the directory.  In that case, the parameter\n              is added to the named directory hash table.\n\n              The second form of c\bcd\bd substitutes the string _\bn_\be_\bw for the string\n              _\bo_\bl_\bd in the name of the current directory, and tries to change to\n              this new directory.\n\n              The third form of c\bcd\bd extracts an entry from the directory stack,\n              and changes to that directory.

If\n              the -\b-L\bL switch is given, the options L\bLO\bOC\bCA\bAL\bL_\b_O\bOP\bPT\bTI\bIO\bON\bNS\bS,\n              L\bLO\bOC\bCA\bAL\bL_\b_P\bPA\bAT\bTT\bTE\bER\bRN\bNS\bS and L\bLO\bOC\bCA\bAL\bL_\b_T\bTR\bRA\bAP\bPS\bS will be set as well, causing the\n              effects of the e\bem\bmu\bul\bla\bat\bte\be command and any s\bse\bet\bto\bop\bpt\bt, d\bdi\bis\bsa\bab\bbl\ble\be -\b-p\bp or\n              e\ben\bna\bab\bbl\ble\be -\b-p\bp, and t\btr\bra\bap\bp commands to be local to the immediately\n              surrounding shell function, if any; normally these options are\n              turned off in all emulation modes except k\bks\bsh\bh. The -\b-L\bL switch is\n              mutually exclusive with the use of -\b-c\bc in _\bf_\bl_\ba_\bg_\bs.\n\n              If there is a single argument and the -\b-l\bl switch is given, the\n              options that would be set or unset (the latter indicated with\n              the prefix `n\bno\bo') are listed.  -\b-l\bl can be combined with -\b-L\bL or -\b-R\bR\n              and the list will be modified in the appropriate way.  Note the\n              list does not depend on the current setting of options, i.e. it\n              includes all options that may in principle change, not just\n              those that would actually change.\n\n              The _\bf_\bl_\ba_\bg_\bs may be any of the invocation-time flags described in\n              the section INVOCATION in _\bz_\bs_\bh(1), except that `-\b-o\bo E\bEM\bMA\bAC\bCS\bS' and `-\b-o\bo\n              V\bVI\bI' may not be used.  Flags such as `+\b+r\br'/`+\b+o\bo R\bRE\bES\bST\bTR\bRI\bIC\bCT\bTE\bED\bD' may be\n              prohibited in some circumstances.\n\n              If -\b-c\bc _\ba_\br_\bg appears in _\bf_\bl_\ba_\bg_\bs, _\ba_\br_\bg is evaluated while the requested\n              emulation is temporarily in effect.  In this case the emulation\n              mode and all options are restored to their previous values\n              before e\bem\bmu\bul\bla\bat\bte\be returns.  The -\b-R\bR switch may precede the name of\n              the shell to emulate; note this has a meaning distinct from\n              including -\b-R\bR in _\bf_\bl_\ba_\bg_\bs.\n\n              Use of -\b-c\bc enables `sticky' emulation mode for functions defined\n              within the evaluated expression:  the emulation mode is\n              associated thereafter with the function so that whenever the\n              function is executed the emulation (respecting the -\b-R\bR switch, if\n              present) and all options are set (and pattern disables cleared)\n              before entry to the function, and the state is restored after\n              exit.  If the function is called when the sticky emulation is\n              already in effect, either within an `e\bem\bmu\bul\bla\bat\bte\be _\bs_\bh_\be_\bl_\bl -\b-c\bc'\n              expression or within another function with the same sticky\n              emulation, entry and exit from the function do not cause options\n              to be altered (except due to standard processing such as the\n              L\bLO\bOC\bCA\bAL\bL_\b_O\bOP\bPT\bTI\bIO\bON\bNS\bS option).  This also applies to functions marked\n              for autoload within the sticky emulation; the appropriate set of\n              options will be applied at the point the function is loaded as\n              well as when it is run.\n\n              For example:\n\n                     e\bem\bmu\bul\bla\bat\bte\be s\bsh\bh -\b-c\bc '\b'f\bfn\bni\bi(\b()\b) {\b{ s\bse\bet\bto\bop\bpt\bt c\bcs\bsh\bhn\bnu\bul\bll\blg\bgl\blo\bob\bb;\b; }\b}\n                     f\bfn\bno\bo(\b()\b) {\b{ f\bfn\bni\bi;\b; }\b}'\b'\n                     f\bfn\bno\bo\n\n              The two functions f\bfn\bni\bi and f\bfn\bno\bo are defined with sticky s\bsh\bh\n              emulation.  f\bfn\bno\bo is then executed, causing options associated\n              with emulations to be set to their values in s\bsh\bh.  f\bfn\bno\bo then calls\n              f\bfn\bni\bi; because f\bfn\bni\bi is also marked for sticky s\bsh\bh emulation, no\n              option changes take place on entry to or exit from it.  Hence\n              the option c\bcs\bsh\bhn\bnu\bul\bll\blg\bgl\blo\bob\bb, turned off by s\bsh\bh emulation, will be\n              turned on within f\bfn\bni\bi and remain on return to f\bfn\bno\bo.  On exit from\n              f\bfn\bno\bo, the emulation mode and all options will be restored to the\n              state they were in before entry to the temporary emulation.\n\n              The documentation above is typically sufficient for the intended\n              purpose of executing code designed for other shells in a\n              suitable environment.  More detailed rules follow.\n              1.     The sticky emulation environment provided by `e\bem\bmu\bul\bla\bat\bte\be\n                     _\bs_\bh_\be_\bl_\bl -\b-c\bc' is identical to that provided by entry to a\n                     function marked for sticky emulation as a consequence of\n                     being defined in such an environment.  Hence, for\n                     example, the sticky emulation is inherited by\n                     subfunctions defined within functions with sticky\n                     emulation.\n              2.     No change of options takes place on entry to or exit from\n                     functions that are not marked for sticky emulation, other\n                     than those that would normally take place, even if those\n                     functions are called within sticky emulation.\n              3.     No special handling is provided for functions marked for\n                     a\bau\but\bto\bol\blo\boa\bad\bd nor for functions present in wordcode created by\n                     the z\bzc\bco\bom\bmp\bpi\bil\ble\be command.\n              4.     The presence or absence of the -\b-R\bR switch to e\bem\bmu\bul\bla\bat\bte\be\n                     corresponds to different sticky emulation modes, so for\n                     example `e\bem\bmu\bul\bla\bat\bte\be s\bsh\bh -\b-c\bc', `e\bem\bmu\bul\bla\bat\bte\be -\b-R\bR s\bsh\bh -\b-c\bc' and `e\bem\bmu\bul\bla\bat\bte\be\n                     c\bcs\bsh\bh -\b-c\bc' are treated as three distinct sticky emulations.\n              5.     Difference in shell options supplied in addition to the\n                     basic emulation also mean the sticky emulations are\n                     different, so for example `e\bem\bmu\bul\bla\bat\bte\be z\bzs\bsh\bh -\b-c\bc' and `e\bem\bmu\bul\bla\bat\bte\be\n                     z\bzs\bsh\bh -\b-o\bo c\bcb\bba\bas\bse\bes\bs -\b-c\bc' are treated as distinct sticky\n                     emulations.\n\n       e\ben\bna\bab\bbl\ble\be [ -\b-a\baf\bfm\bmp\bpr\brs\bs ] _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be ...\n              Enable the _\bn_\ba_\bm_\bed hash table elements, presumably disabled\n              earlier with d\bdi\bis\bsa\bab\bbl\ble\be.  The default is to enable builtin\n              commands.  The -\b-a\ba option causes e\ben\bna\bab\bbl\ble\be to act on regular or\n              global aliases.  The -\b-s\bs option causes e\ben\bna\bab\bbl\ble\be to act on suffix\n              aliases.  The -\b-f\bf option causes e\ben\bna\bab\bbl\ble\be to act on shell functions.\n              The -\b-r\br option causes e\ben\bna\bab\bbl\ble\be to act on reserved words.  Without\n              arguments all enabled hash table elements from the corresponding\n              hash table are printed.  With the -\b-m\bm flag the arguments are\n              taken as patterns (should be quoted) and all hash table elements\n              from the corresponding hash table matching these patterns are\n              enabled.  Enabled objects can be disabled with the d\bdi\bis\bsa\bab\bbl\ble\be\n              builtin command.\n\n              e\ben\bna\bab\bbl\ble\be -\b-p\bp reenables patterns disabled with d\bdi\bis\bsa\bab\bbl\ble\be -\b-p\bp.  Note\n              that it does not override globbing options; for example, `e\ben\bna\bab\bbl\ble\be\n              -\b-p\bp \"\b\"~\b~\"\b\"' does not cause the pattern character ~\b~ to be active\n              unless the E\bEX\bXT\bTE\bEN\bND\bDE\bED\bD_\b_G\bGL\bLO\bOB\bB option is also set.  To enable all\n              possible patterns (so that they may be individually disabled\n              with d\bdi\bis\bsa\bab\bbl\ble\be -\b-p\bp), use `s\bse\bet\bto\bop\bpt\bt E\bEX\bXT\bTE\bEN\bND\bDE\bED\bD_\b_G\bGL\bLO\bOB\bB K\bKS\bSH\bH_\b_G\bGL\bLO\bOB\bB\n              N\bNO\bO_\b_S\bSH\bH_\b_G\bGL\bLO\bOB\bB'.\n\n       e\bev\bva\bal\bl [ _\ba_\br_\bg ... ]\n              Read the arguments as input to the shell and execute the\n              resulting command(s) in the current shell process.  The return\n              status is the same as if the commands had been executed directly\n              by the shell; if there are no _\ba_\br_\bg_\bs or they contain no commands\n              (i.e. are an empty string or whitespace) the return status is\n              zero.\n\n       e\bex\bxe\bec\bc [ -\b-c\bcl\bl ] [ -\b-a\ba _\ba_\br_\bg_\bv_\b0 ] [ _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd [ _\ba_\br_\bg ... ] ]\n              Replace the current shell with _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd rather than forking.  If\n              _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd is a shell builtin command or a shell function, the\n              shell executes it, and exits when the command is complete.\n\n              With -\b-c\bc clear the environment; with -\b-l\bl prepend -\b- to the a\bar\brg\bgv\bv[\b[0\b0]\b]\n              string of the command executed (to simulate a login shell); with\n              -\b-a\ba _\ba_\br_\bg_\bv_\b0 set the a\bar\brg\bgv\bv[\b[0\b0]\b] string of the command executed.  See\n              the section `Precommand Modifiers' in _\bz_\bs_\bh_\bm_\bi_\bs_\bc(1).\n\n              If the option P\bPO\bOS\bSI\bIX\bX_\b_B\bBU\bUI\bIL\bLT\bTI\bIN\bNS\bS is set, _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd is never\n              interpreted as a shell builtin command or shell function.  This\n              means further precommand modifiers such as b\bbu\bui\bil\blt\bti\bin\bn and n\bno\bog\bgl\blo\bob\bb\n              are also not interpreted within the shell.  Hence _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd is\n              always found by searching the command path.\n\n              If _\bc_\bo_\bm_\bm_\ba_\bn_\bd is omitted but any redirections are specified, then\n              the redirections will take effect in the current shell.\n\n       e\bex\bxi\bit\bt [ _\bn ]\n              Exit the shell with the exit status specified by an arithmetic\n              expression _\bn; if none is specified, use the exit status from the\n              last command executed.  An EOF condition will also cause the\n              shell to exit, unless the I\bIG\bGN\bNO\bOR\bRE\bE_\b_E\bEO\bOF\bF option is set.\n\n              See notes at the end of the section JOBS in _\bz_\bs_\bh_\bm_\bi_\bs_\bc(1) for some\n              possibly unexpected interactions of the e\bex\bxi\bit\bt command with jobs.\n\n       e\bex\bxp\bpo\bor\brt\bt [ _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be[=\b=_\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be] ... ]\n              The specified _\bn_\ba_\bm_\bes are marked for automatic export to the\n              environment of subsequently executed commands.

Note\n              that reading and writing of history options is only performed if\n              the shell is interactive.  Usually this is detected\n              automatically, but it can be forced by setting the i\bin\bnt\bte\ber\bra\bac\bct\bti\biv\bve\be\n              option when starting the shell.\n\n              The first two forms of this command select a range of events\n              from _\bf_\bi_\br_\bs_\bt to _\bl_\ba_\bs_\bt from the history list.  The arguments _\bf_\bi_\br_\bs_\bt\n              and _\bl_\ba_\bs_\bt may be specified as a number or as a string.  A\n              negative number is used as an offset to the current history\n              event number.  A string specifies the most recent event\n              beginning with the given string.  All substitutions _\bo_\bl_\bd=\b=_\bn_\be_\bw, if\n              any, are then performed on the text of the events.\n\n              The range of events selected by numbers can be narrowed further\n              by the following flags.\n              -\b-I\bI     restricts to only internal events (not from $\b$H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTF\bFI\bIL\bLE\bE)\n              -\b-L\bL     restricts to only local events (not from other shells,\n                     see S\bSH\bHA\bAR\bRE\bE_\b_H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTO\bOR\bRY\bY in _\bz_\bs_\bh_\bo_\bp_\bt_\bi_\bo_\bn_\bs(1) -- note that $\b$H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTF\bFI\bIL\bLE\bE\n                     is considered local when read at startup)\n              -\b-m\bm     takes the first argument as a pattern (which should be\n                     quoted) and only the history events matching this pattern\n                     are considered\n\n              If _\bf_\bi_\br_\bs_\bt is not specified, it will be set to -1 (the most recent\n              event), or to -16 if the -\b-l\bl flag is given.  If _\bl_\ba_\bs_\bt is not\n              specified, it will be set to _\bf_\bi_\br_\bs_\bt, or to -1 if the -\b-l\bl flag is\n              given.  However, if the current event has added entries to the\n              history with `p\bpr\bri\bin\bnt\bt -\b-s\bs' or `f\bfc\bc -\b-R\bR', then the default _\bl_\ba_\bs_\bt for -\b-l\bl\n              includes all new history entries since the current event began.\n\n              When the -\b-l\bl flag is given, the resulting events are listed on\n              standard output.  Otherwise the editor program specified by -\b-e\be\n              _\be_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be is invoked on a file containing these history events.  If\n              -\b-e\be is not given, the value of the parameter F\bFC\bCE\bED\bDI\bIT\bT is used; if\n              that is not set the value of the parameter E\bED\bDI\bIT\bTO\bOR\bR is used; if\n              that is not set a builtin default, usually `v\bvi\bi' is used.

If the -\b-a\ba option is also\n              specified, this history list will be automatically popped when\n              the current function scope is exited, which is a much better\n              solution than creating a trap function to call `f\bfc\bc -\b-P\bP' manually.\n              If no arguments are specified, the history list is left empty,\n              $\b$H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTF\bFI\bIL\bLE\bE is unset, and $\b$H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTS\bSI\bIZ\bZE\bE & $\b$S\bSA\bAV\bVE\bEH\bHI\bIS\bST\bT are set to their\n              default values.

You are free to change these environment\n              values for the new history list however you desire in order to\n              manipulate the new history list.\n\n              `f\bfc\bc -\b-P\bP' pops the history list back to an older list saved by `f\bfc\bc\n              -\b-p\bp'.  The current list is saved to its $\b$H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTF\bFI\bIL\bLE\bE before it is\n              destroyed (assuming that $\b$H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTF\bFI\bIL\bLE\bE and $\b$S\bSA\bAV\bVE\bEH\bHI\bIS\bST\bT are set\n              appropriately, of course).

Note that this restoration can conflict with making\n              these variables \"local\", so your best bet is to avoid local\n              declarations for these variables in functions that use `f\bfc\bc -\b-p\bp'.\n              The one other guaranteed-safe combination is declaring these\n              variables to be local at the top of your function and using the\n              automatic option (-\b-a\ba) with `f\bfc\bc -\b-p\bp'.  Finally, note that it is\n              legal to manually pop a push marked for automatic popping if you\n              need to do so before the function exits.\n\n              `f\bfc\bc -\b-R\bR' reads the history from the given file, `f\bfc\bc -\b-W\bW' writes\n              the history out to the given file, and `f\bfc\bc -\b-A\bA' appends the\n              history out to the given file.  If no filename is specified, the\n              $\b$H\bHI\bIS\bST\bTF\bFI\bIL\bLE\bE is assumed.

The copy is\n              efficiently handled internally by reference counting.  If _\bo_\bl_\bd_\bf_\bn\n              was marked for autoload it is first loaded and if this fails the\n              copy fails.

A typical idiom is that _\bo_\bl_\bd_\bf_\bn is\n              the name of a library shell function which is then redefined to\n              call n\bne\bew\bwf\bfn\bn, thereby installing a modified version of the\n              function.\n\n              _\bT_\bh_\be -\b-M\bM _\ba_\bn_\bd +\b+M\bM _\bf_\bl_\ba_\bg_\bs\n\n              Use of the -\b-M\bM option may not be combined with any of the options\n              handled by t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt -\b-f\bf.\n\n              f\bfu\bun\bnc\bct\bti\bio\bon\bns\bs -\b-M\bM _\bm_\ba_\bt_\bh_\bf_\bn defines _\bm_\ba_\bt_\bh_\bf_\bn as the name of a mathematical\n              function recognised in all forms of arithmetical expressions;\n              see the section `Arithmetic Evaluation' in _\bz_\bs_\bh_\bm_\bi_\bs_\bc(1).  By\n              default _\bm_\ba_\bt_\bh_\bf_\bn may take any number of comma-separated arguments.\n              If _\bm_\bi_\bn is given, it must have exactly _\bm_\bi_\bn args; if _\bm_\bi_\bn and _\bm_\ba_\bx\n              are both given, it must have at least _\bm_\bi_\bn and at most _\bm_\ba_\bx args.\n              _\bm_\ba_\bx may be -1 to indicate that there is no upper limit.\n\n              By default the function is implemented by a shell function of\n              the same name; if _\bs_\bh_\be_\bl_\bl_\bf_\bn is specified it gives the name of the\n              corresponding shell function while _\bm_\ba_\bt_\bh_\bf_\bn remains the name used\n              in arithmetical expressions.  The name of the function in $\b$0\b0 is\n              _\bm_\ba_\bt_\bh_\bf_\bn (not _\bs_\bh_\be_\bl_\bl_\bf_\bn as would usually be the case), provided the\n              option F\bFU\bUN\bNC\bCT\bTI\bIO\bON\bN_\b_A\bAR\bRG\bGZ\bZE\bER\bRO\bO is in effect.  The positional parameters\n              in the shell function correspond to the arguments of the\n              mathematical function call.\n\n              The result of the last arithmetical expression evaluated inside\n              the shell function gives the result of the mathematical\n              function.  This is not limited to arithmetic substitutions of\n              the form $\b$(\b((\b(_\b._\b._\b.)\b))\b), but also includes arithmetical expressions\n              evaluated in any other way, including by the l\ble\bet\bt builtin, by\n              (\b((\b(_\b._\b._\b.)\b))\b) statements, and even by the r\bre\bet\btu\bur\brn\bn builtin and by array\n              subscripts.  Therefore, care must be taken not to use\n              syntactical constructs that perform arithmetic evaluation after\n              evaluating what is to be the result of the function.

The option argument, if any, is stored in O\bOP\bPT\bTA\bAR\bRG\bG.\n\n              The first option to be examined may be changed by explicitly\n              assigning to O\bOP\bPT\bTI\bIN\bND\bD.  O\bOP\bPT\bTI\bIN\bND\bD has an initial value of 1\b1, and is\n              normally set to 1\b1 upon entry to a shell function and restored\n              upon exit.  (The P\bPO\bOS\bSI\bIX\bX_\b_B\bBU\bUI\bIL\bLT\bTI\bIN\bNS\bS option disables this, and also\n              changes the way the value is calculated to match other shells.)\n              O\bOP\bPT\bTA\bAR\bRG\bG is not reset and retains its value from the most recent\n              call to g\bge\bet\bto\bop\bpt\bts\bs.  If either of O\bOP\bPT\bTI\bIN\bND\bD or O\bOP\bPT\bTA\bAR\bRG\bG is explicitly\n              unset, it remains unset, and the index or option argument is not\n              stored.  The option itself is still stored in _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be in this case.\n\n              A leading `:\b:' in _\bo_\bp_\bt_\bs_\bt_\br_\bi_\bn_\bg causes g\bge\bet\bto\bop\bpt\bts\bs to store the letter of\n              any invalid option in O\bOP\bPT\bTA\bAR\bRG\bG, and to set _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be to `?\b?' for an\n              unknown option and to `:\b:' when a required argument is missing.\n              Otherwise, g\bge\bet\bto\bop\bpt\bts\bs sets _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be to `?\b?' and prints an error message\n              when an option is invalid.  The exit status is nonzero when\n              there are no more options.\n\n       h\bha\bas\bsh\bh [ -\b-L\bLd\bdf\bfm\bmr\brv\bv ] [ _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be[=\b=_\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be] ] ...\n              h\bha\bas\bsh\bh can be used to directly modify the contents of the command\n              hash table, and the named directory hash table.  Normally one\n              would modify these tables by modifying one's P\bPA\bAT\bTH\bH (for the\n              command hash table) or by creating appropriate shell parameters\n              (for the named directory hash table).  The choice of hash table\n              to work on is determined by the -\b-d\bd option; without the option\n              the command hash table is used, and with the option the named\n              directory hash table is used.\n\n              A command _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be starting with a /\b/ is never hashed, whether by\n              explicit use of the h\bha\bas\bsh\bh command or otherwise.  Such a command\n              is always found by direct look up in the file system.\n\n              Given no arguments, and neither the -\b-r\br or -\b-f\bf options, the\n              selected hash table will be listed in full.\n\n              The -\b-r\br option causes the selected hash table to be emptied.  It\n              will be subsequently rebuilt in the normal fashion.  The -\b-f\bf\n              option causes the selected hash table to be fully rebuilt\n              immediately.  For the command hash table this hashes all the\n              absolute directories in the P\bPA\bAT\bTH\bH, and for the named directory\n              hash table this adds all users' home directories.  These two\n              options cannot be used with any arguments.\n\n              The -\b-m\bm option causes the arguments to be taken as patterns\n              (which should be quoted) and the elements of the hash table\n              matching those patterns are printed.  This is the only way to\n              display a limited selection of hash table elements.\n\n              For each _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be with a corresponding _\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be, put `_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be' in the\n              selected hash table, associating it with the pathname `_\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be'.\n              In the command hash table, this means that whenever `_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be' is\n              used as a command argument, the shell will try to execute the\n              file given by `_\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be'.  In the named directory hash table, this\n              means that `_\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be' may be referred to as `~\b~_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be'.\n\n              For each _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be with no corresponding _\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be, attempt to add _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be\n              to the hash table, checking what the appropriate v\bva\bal\blu\bue\be is in the\n              normal manner for that hash table.  If an appropriate v\bva\bal\blu\bue\be\n              can't be found, then the hash table will be unchanged.\n\n              The -\b-v\bv option causes hash table entries to be listed as they are\n              added by explicit specification.  If has no effect if used with\n              -\b-f\bf.\n\n              If the -\b-L\bL flag is present, then each hash table entry is printed\n              in the form of a call to hash.\n\n       h\bhi\bis\bst\bto\bor\bry\by\n              Same as f\bfc\bc -\b-l\bl.\n\n       i\bin\bnt\bte\beg\bge\ber\br [ {+\b+|-\b-}H\bHg\bgh\bhl\blp\bpr\brt\btu\bux\bx ] [ {+\b+|-\b-}L\bLR\bRZ\bZi\bi [ _\bn ] ] [ _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be[=\b=_\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be] ... ]\n              Equivalent to t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt -\b-i\bi, except that options irrelevant to\n              integers are not permitted.\n\n       j\bjo\bob\bbs\bs [ -\b-d\bdl\blp\bpr\brs\bs ] [ _\bj_\bo_\bb ... ]\n       j\bjo\bob\bbs\bs -\b-Z\bZ _\bs_\bt_\br_\bi_\bn_\bg\n              Lists information about each given job, or all jobs if _\bj_\bo_\bb is\n              omitted.

Only the -\b-e\be and -\b-n\bn\n                     flags are recognized after -\b-R\bR; all other arguments and\n                     options are printed.\n\n              -\b-s\bs     Place the results in the history list instead of on the\n                     standard output.  Each argument to the p\bpr\bri\bin\bnt\bt command is\n                     treated as a single word in the history, regardless of\n                     its content.\n\n              -\b-S\bS     Place the results in the history list instead of on the\n                     standard output.

Note that leading tabs of any\n                     argument to print, not just the first, are expanded, even\n                     if p\bpr\bri\bin\bnt\bt is using spaces to separate arguments (the\n                     column count is maintained across arguments but may be\n                     incorrect on output owing to previous unexpanded tabs).\n\n                     The start of the output of each print command is assumed\n                     to be aligned with a tab stop.  Widths of multibyte\n                     characters are handled if the option M\bMU\bUL\bLT\bTI\bIB\bBY\bYT\bTE\bE is in\n                     effect.  This option is ignored if other formatting\n                     options are in effect, namely column alignment or p\bpr\bri\bin\bnt\btf\bf\n                     style, or if output is to a special location such as\n                     shell history or the command line editor.\n\n              -\b-X\bX _\bt_\ba_\bb_\b-_\bs_\bt_\bo_\bp\n                     This is similar to -\b-x\bx, except that all tabs in the\n                     printed string are expanded.  This is appropriate if tabs\n                     in the arguments are being used to produce a table\n                     format.\n\n              -\b-z\bz     Push the arguments onto the editing buffer stack,\n                     separated by spaces.\n\n              If any of `-\b-m\bm', `-\b-o\bo' or `-\b-O\bO' are used in combination with `-\b-f\bf'\n              and there are no arguments (after the removal process in the\n              case of `-\b-m\bm') then nothing is printed.\n\n       p\bpr\bri\bin\bnt\btf\bf [ -\b-v\bv _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be ] _\bf_\bo_\br_\bm_\ba_\bt [ _\ba_\br_\bg ... ]\n              Print the arguments according to the format specification.\n              Formatting rules are the same as used in C. The same escape\n              sequences as for e\bec\bch\bho\bo are recognised in the format. All C\n              conversion specifications ending in one of c\bcs\bsd\bdi\bio\bou\bux\bxX\bXe\beE\bEf\bfg\bgG\bGn\bn are\n              handled. In addition to this, `%\b%b\bb' can be used instead of `%\b%s\bs'\n              to cause escape sequences in the argument to be recognised and\n              `%\b%q\bq' can be used to quote the argument in such a way that allows\n              it to be reused as shell input. With the numeric format\n              specifiers, if the corresponding argument starts with a quote\n              character, the numeric value of the following character is used\n              as the number to print; otherwise the argument is evaluated as\n              an arithmetic expression. See the section `Arithmetic\n              Evaluation' in _\bz_\bs_\bh_\bm_\bi_\bs_\bc(1) for a description of arithmetic\n              expressions. With `%\b%n\bn', the corresponding argument is taken as\n              an identifier which is created as an integer parameter.\n\n              Normally, conversion specifications are applied to each argument\n              in order but they can explicitly specify the _\bnth argument is to\n              be used by replacing `%\b%' by `%\b%_\bn$\b$' and `*\b*' by `*\b*_\bn$\b$'.  It is\n              recommended that you do not mix references of this explicit\n              style with the normal style and the handling of such mixed\n              styles may be subject to future change.\n\n              If arguments remain unused after formatting, the format string\n              is reused until all arguments have been consumed. With the p\bpr\bri\bin\bnt\bt\n              builtin, this can be suppressed by using the -\b-r\br option. If more\n              arguments are required by the format than have been specified,\n              the behaviour is as if zero or an empty string had been\n              specified as the argument.\n\n              The -\b-v\bv option causes the output to be stored as the value of the\n              parameter _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be, instead of printed. If _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be is an array and the\n              format string is reused when consuming arguments then one array\n              element will be used for each use of the format string.\n\n       p\bpu\bus\bsh\bhd\bd [ -\b-q\bqs\bsL\bLP\bP ] [ _\ba_\br_\bg ]\n       p\bpu\bus\bsh\bhd\bd [ -\b-q\bqs\bsL\bLP\bP ] _\bo_\bl_\bd _\bn_\be_\bw\n       p\bpu\bus\bsh\bhd\bd [ -\b-q\bqs\bsL\bLP\bP ] {+\b+|-\b-}_\bn\n              Change the current directory, and push the old current directory\n              onto the directory stack.

Otherwise, _\ba_\br_\bg is\n              interpreted as it would be by c\bcd\bd.  The meaning of _\bo_\bl_\bd and _\bn_\be_\bw in\n              the second form is also the same as for c\bcd\bd.\n\n              The third form of p\bpu\bus\bsh\bhd\bd changes directory by rotating the\n              directory list.

If\n                     _\bn_\bu_\bm is present, it must begin with a digit and will be\n                     evaluated to give a number of seconds, which may be a\n                     floating point number; in this case the read times out if\n                     input is not available within this time.  If _\bn_\bu_\bm is not\n                     present, it is taken to be zero, so that r\bre\bea\bad\bd returns\n                     immediately if no input is available.  If no input is\n                     available, return status 1 and do not set any variables.\n\n                     This option is not available when reading from the editor\n                     buffer with -\b-z\bz, when called from within completion with\n                     -\b-c\bc or -\b-l\bl, with -\b-q\bq which clears the input queue before\n                     reading, or within zle where other mechanisms should be\n                     used to test for input.\n\n                     Note that read does not attempt to alter the input\n                     processing mode.  The default mode is canonical input, in\n                     which an entire line is read at a time, so usually `r\bre\bea\bad\bd\n                     -\b-t\bt' will not read anything until an entire line has been\n                     typed.  However, when reading from the terminal with -\b-k\bk\n                     input is processed one key at a time; in this case, only\n                     availability of the first character is tested, so that\n                     e.g. `r\bre\bea\bad\bd -\b-t\bt -\b-k\bk 2\b2' can still block on the second\n                     character.  Use two instances of `r\bre\bea\bad\bd -\b-t\bt -\b-k\bk' if this is\n                     not what is wanted.\n\n              If the first argument contains a `?\b?', the remainder of this word\n              is used as a _\bp_\br_\bo_\bm_\bp_\bt on standard error when the shell is\n              interactive.\n\n              The value (exit status) of r\bre\bea\bad\bd is 1 when an end-of-file is\n              encountered, or when -\b-c\bc or -\b-l\bl is present and the command is not\n              called from a c\bco\bom\bmp\bpc\bct\btl\bl function, or as described for -\b-q\bq.\n              Otherwise the value is 0.\n\n              The behavior of some combinations of the -\b-k\bk, -\b-p\bp, -\b-q\bq, -\b-u\bu and -\b-z\bz\n              flags is undefined.  Presently -\b-q\bq cancels all the others, -\b-p\bp\n              cancels -\b-u\bu, -\b-k\bk cancels -\b-z\bz, and otherwise -\b-z\bz cancels both -\b-p\bp and\n              -\b-u\bu.\n\n              The -\b-c\bc or -\b-l\bl flags cancel any and all of -\b-k\bkp\bpq\bqu\buz\bz.\n\n       r\bre\bea\bad\bdo\bon\bnl\bly\by\n              Same as t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt -\b-r\br.

For example, the following prints `4\b42\b2':\n\n                     (\b()\b) {\b{ i\bin\bnt\bte\beg\bge\ber\br f\bfo\boo\bo=\b=4\b40\b0;\b; r\bre\bet\btu\bur\brn\bn \"\b\"f\bfo\boo\bo +\b+ 2\b2\"\b\" }\b}\n                     e\bec\bch\bho\bo $\b$?\b?\n\n              If _\bn is omitted, the return status is that of the last command\n              executed.\n\n              If r\bre\bet\btu\bur\brn\bn was executed from a trap in a T\bTR\bRA\bAP\bP_\bN_\bA_\bL function, the\n              effect is different for zero and non-zero return status.  With\n              zero status (or after an implicit return at the end of the\n              trap), the shell will return to whatever it was previously\n              processing; with a non-zero status, the shell will behave as\n              interrupted except that the return status of the trap is\n              retained.  Note that the numeric value of the signal which\n              caused the trap is passed as the first argument, so the\n              statement `r\bre\bet\btu\bur\brn\bn \"\b\"1\b12\b28\b8+\b+$\b$1\b1\"\b\"' will return the same status as if\n              the signal had not been trapped.\n\n       s\bsc\bch\bhe\bed\bd  See the section `The zsh/sched Module' in _\bz_\bs_\bh_\bm_\bo_\bd_\bu_\bl_\be_\bs(1).\n\n\n       s\bse\bet\bt [ {+\b+|-\b-}_\bo_\bp_\bt_\bi_\bo_\bn_\bs | {+\b+|-\b-}o\bo [ _\bo_\bp_\bt_\bi_\bo_\bn_\b__\bn_\ba_\bm_\be ] ] ...

With +\b+s\bs sort arguments in descending\n              order.  For the meaning of the other flags, see _\bz_\bs_\bh_\bo_\bp_\bt_\bi_\bo_\bn_\bs(1).\n              Flags may be specified by name using the -\b-o\bo option.

With +\b+o\bo they are printed in a form that can be used as\n              input to the shell.\n\n              If the -\b-A\bA flag is specified, _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be is set to an array containing\n              the given _\ba_\br_\bgs; if no _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be is specified, all arrays are printed\n              together with their values.\n\n              If +\b+A\bA is used and _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be is an array, the given arguments will\n              replace the initial elements of that array; if no _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be is\n              specified, all arrays are printed without their values.\n\n              The behaviour of arguments after -\b-A\bA _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be or +\b+A\bA _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be depends on\n              whether the option K\bKS\bSH\bH_\b_A\bAR\bRR\bRA\bAY\bYS\bS is set.  If it is not set, all\n              arguments following _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be are treated as values for the array,\n              regardless of their form.  If the option is set, normal option\n              processing continues at that point; only regular arguments are\n              treated as values for the array.  This means that\n\n                     s\bse\bet\bt -\b-A\bA a\bar\brr\bra\bay\by -\b-x\bx -\b--\b- f\bfo\boo\bo\n\n              sets a\bar\brr\bra\bay\by to `-\b-x\bx -\b--\b- f\bfo\boo\bo' if K\bKS\bSH\bH_\b_A\bAR\bRR\bRA\bAY\bYS\bS is not set, but sets the\n              array to f\bfo\boo\bo and turns on the option `-\b-x\bx' if it is set.\n\n              If the -\b-A\bA flag is not present, but there are arguments beyond\n              the options, the positional parameters are set.  If the option\n              list (if any) is terminated by `-\b--\b-', and there are no further\n              arguments, the positional parameters will be unset.\n\n              If no arguments and no `-\b--\b-' are given, then the names and values\n              of all parameters are printed on the standard output.

The form is chosen so as to minimize the\n              differences from the default options for the current emulation\n              (the default emulation being native z\bzs\bsh\bh, shown as <\b<Z\bZ>\b> in\n              _\bz_\bs_\bh_\bo_\bp_\bt_\bi_\bo_\bn_\bs(1)).

In addition to options changed from the default\n              state by the user, any options activated automatically by the\n              shell (for example, S\bSH\bHI\bIN\bN_\b_S\bST\bTD\bDI\bIN\bN or I\bIN\bNT\bTE\bER\bRA\bAC\bCT\bTI\bIV\bVE\bE) will be shown in\n              the list.

Added for compatibility; use\n              conditional expressions instead (see the section `Conditional\n              Expressions').  The main differences between the conditional\n              expression syntax and the t\bte\bes\bst\bt and [\b[ builtins are:  these\n              commands are not handled syntactically, so for example an empty\n              variable expansion may cause an argument to be omitted; syntax\n              errors cause status 2 to be returned instead of a shell error;\n              and arithmetic operators expect integer arguments rather than\n              arithmetic expressions.\n\n              The command attempts to implement POSIX and its extensions where\n              these are specified.  Unfortunately there are intrinsic\n              ambiguities in the syntax; in particular there is no distinction\n              between test operators and strings that resemble them.  The\n              standard attempts to resolve these for small numbers of\n              arguments (up to four); for five or more arguments compatibility\n              cannot be relied on.  Users are urged wherever possible to use\n              the `[\b[[\b[' test syntax which does not have these ambiguities.\n\n       t\bti\bim\bme\bes\bs  Print the accumulated user and system times for the shell and\n              for processes run from the shell.\n\n       t\btr\bra\bap\bp [ _\ba_\br_\bg ] [ _\bs_\bi_\bg ... ]\n              _\ba_\br_\bg is a series of commands (usually quoted to protect it from\n              immediate evaluation by the shell) to be read and executed when\n              the shell receives any of the signals specified by one or more\n              _\bs_\bi_\bg args.  Each _\bs_\bi_\bg can be given as a number, or as the name of\n              a signal either with or without the string S\bSI\bIG\bG in front (e.g. 1,\n              HUP, and SIGHUP are all the same signal).\n\n              If _\ba_\br_\bg is `-\b-', then the specified signals are reset to their\n              defaults, or, if no _\bs_\bi_\bg args are present, all traps are reset.\n\n              If _\ba_\br_\bg is an empty string, then the specified signals are\n              ignored by the shell (and by the commands it invokes).\n\n              If _\ba_\br_\bg is omitted but one or more _\bs_\bi_\bg args are provided (i.e.\n              the first argument is a valid signal number or name), the effect\n              is the same as if _\ba_\br_\bg had been specified as `-\b-'.\n\n              The t\btr\bra\bap\bp command with no arguments prints a list of commands\n              associated with each signal.\n\n              If _\bs_\bi_\bg is Z\bZE\bER\bRR\bR then _\ba_\br_\bg will be executed after each command with\n              a nonzero exit status.  E\bER\bRR\bR is an alias for Z\bZE\bER\bRR\bR on systems that\n              have no S\bSI\bIG\bGE\bER\bRR\bR signal (this is the usual case).\n\n              If _\bs_\bi_\bg is D\bDE\bEB\bBU\bUG\bG then _\ba_\br_\bg will be executed before each command if\n              the option D\bDE\bEB\bBU\bUG\bG_\b_B\bBE\bEF\bFO\bOR\bRE\bE_\b_C\bCM\bMD\bD is set (as it is by default), else\n              after each command.  Here, a `command' is what is described as a\n              `sublist' in the shell grammar, see the section SIMPLE COMMANDS\n              & PIPELINES in _\bz_\bs_\bh_\bm_\bi_\bs_\bc(1).  If D\bDE\bEB\bBU\bUG\bG_\b_B\bBE\bEF\bFO\bOR\bRE\bE_\b_C\bCM\bMD\bD is set various\n              additional features are available.  First, it is possible to\n              skip the next command by setting the option E\bER\bRR\bR_\b_E\bEX\bXI\bIT\bT; see the\n              description of the E\bER\bRR\bR_\b_E\bEX\bXI\bIT\bT option in _\bz_\bs_\bh_\bo_\bp_\bt_\bi_\bo_\bn_\bs(1).  Also, the\n              shell parameter Z\bZS\bSH\bH_\b_D\bDE\bEB\bBU\bUG\bG_\b_C\bCM\bMD\bD is set to the string corresponding\n              to the command to be executed following the trap.  Note that\n              this string is reconstructed from the internal format and may\n              not be formatted the same way as the original text.  The\n              parameter is unset after the trap is executed.\n\n              If _\bs_\bi_\bg is 0\b0 or E\bEX\bXI\bIT\bT and the t\btr\bra\bap\bp statement is executed inside\n              the body of a function, then the command _\ba_\br_\bg is executed after\n              the function completes.  The value of $\b$?\b? at the start of\n              execution is the exit status of the shell or the return status\n              of the function exiting.  If _\bs_\bi_\bg is 0\b0 or E\bEX\bXI\bIT\bT and the t\btr\bra\bap\bp\n              statement is not executed inside the body of a function, then\n              the command _\ba_\br_\bg is executed when the shell terminates; the trap\n              runs before any z\bzs\bsh\bhe\bex\bxi\bit\bt hook functions.\n\n              Z\bZE\bER\bRR\bR, D\bDE\bEB\bBU\bUG\bG, and E\bEX\bXI\bIT\bT traps are not executed inside other traps.\n              Z\bZE\bER\bRR\bR and D\bDE\bEB\bBU\bUG\bG traps are kept within subshells, while other\n              traps are reset.\n\n              Note that traps defined with the t\btr\bra\bap\bp builtin are slightly\n              different from those defined as `T\bTR\bRA\bAP\bP_\bN_\bA_\bL () { ... }', as the\n              latter have their own function environment (line numbers, local\n              variables, etc.) while the former use the environment of the\n              command in which they were called.  For example,\n\n                     t\btr\bra\bap\bp '\b'p\bpr\bri\bin\bnt\bt $\b$L\bLI\bIN\bNE\bEN\bNO\bO'\b' D\bDE\bEB\bBU\bUG\bG\n\n              will print the line number of a command executed after it has\n              run, while\n\n                     T\bTR\bRA\bAP\bPD\bDE\bEB\bBU\bUG\bG(\b()\b) {\b{ p\bpr\bri\bin\bnt\bt $\b$L\bLI\bIN\bNE\bEN\bNO\bO;\b; }\b}\n\n              will always print the number zero.\n\n              Alternative signal names are allowed as described under k\bki\bil\bll\bl\n              above.  Defining a trap under either name causes any trap under\n              an alternative name to be removed.  However, it is recommended\n              that for consistency users stick exclusively to one name or\n              another.\n\n       t\btr\bru\bue\be [ _\ba_\br_\bg ... ]\n              Do nothing and return an exit status of 0.\n\n       t\btt\bty\byc\bct\btl\bl [ -\b-f\bfu\bu ]\n              The -\b-f\bf option freezes the tty (i.e. terminal or terminal\n              emulator), and -\b-u\bu unfreezes it.  When the tty is frozen, no\n              changes made to the tty settings by external programs will be\n              honored by the shell, except for changes in the size of the\n              screen; the shell will simply reset the settings to their\n              previous values as soon as each command exits or is suspended.\n              Thus, s\bst\btt\bty\by and similar programs have no effect when the tty is\n              frozen.  Freezing the tty does not cause the current state to be\n              remembered: instead, it causes future changes to the state to be\n              blocked.\n\n              Without options it reports whether the terminal is frozen or\n              not.\n\n              Note that, regardless of whether the tty is frozen or not, the\n              shell needs to change the settings when the line editor starts,\n              so unfreezing the tty does not guarantee settings made on the\n              command line are preserved.  Strings of commands run between\n              editing the command line will see a consistent tty state.

When inside a function, a new parameter\n              is created for every _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be (even those that already exist), and\n              is unset again when the function completes.  See `Local\n              Parameters' in _\bz_\bs_\bh_\bp_\ba_\br_\ba_\bm(1).  The same rules apply to special\n              shell parameters, which retain their special attributes when\n              made local.\n\n              For each _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be=\b=_\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be assignment, the parameter _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be is set to\n              _\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be.  If the assignment is omitted and _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be does _\bn_\bo_\bt refer to\n              an existing parameter, a new parameter is intialized to empty\n              string, zero, or empty array (as appropriate), _\bu_\bn_\bl_\be_\bs_\bs the shell\n              option T\bTY\bYP\bPE\bES\bSE\bET\bT_\b_T\bTO\bO_\b_U\bUN\bNS\bSE\bET\bT is set.  When that option is set, the\n              parameter attributes are recorded but the parameter remains\n              unset.\n\n              If the shell option T\bTY\bYP\bPE\bES\bSE\bET\bT_\b_S\bSI\bIL\bLE\bEN\bNT\bT is not set, for each\n              remaining _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be that refers to a parameter that is already set,\n              the name and value of the parameter are printed in the form of\n              an assignment.  Nothing is printed for newly-created parameters,\n              or when any attribute flags listed below are given along with\n              the _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be.  Using `+\b+' instead of minus to introduce an attribute\n              turns it off.\n\n              If no _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be is present, the names and values of all parameters\n              are printed.  In this case the attribute flags restrict the\n              display to only those parameters that have the specified\n              attributes, and using `+\b+' rather than `-\b-' to introduce the flag\n              suppresses printing of the values of parameters when there is no\n              parameter name.\n\n              All forms of the command handle scalar assignment.  Array\n              assignment is possible if any of the reserved words d\bde\bec\bcl\bla\bar\bre\be,\n              e\bex\bxp\bpo\bor\brt\bt, f\bfl\blo\boa\bat\bt, i\bin\bnt\bte\beg\bge\ber\br, l\blo\boc\bca\bal\bl, r\bre\bea\bad\bdo\bon\bnl\bly\by or t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt is matched\n              when the line is parsed (N.B. not when it is executed).  In this\n              case the arguments are parsed as assignments, except that the\n              `+\b+=\b=' syntax and the G\bGL\bLO\bOB\bB_\b_A\bAS\bSS\bSI\bIG\bGN\bN option are not supported, and\n              scalar values after =\b= are _\bn_\bo_\bt split further into words, even if\n              expanded (regardless of the setting of the K\bKS\bSH\bH_\b_T\bTY\bYP\bPE\bES\bSE\bET\bT option;\n              this option is obsolete).\n\n              Examples of the differences between command and reserved word\n              parsing:\n\n                     #\b# R\bRe\bes\bse\ber\brv\bve\bed\bd w\bwo\bor\brd\bd p\bpa\bar\brs\bsi\bin\bng\bg\n                     t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt s\bsv\bva\bar\br=\b=$\b$(\b(e\bec\bch\bho\bo o\bon\bne\be w\bwo\bor\brd\bd)\b) a\bav\bva\bar\br=\b=(\b(s\bse\bev\bve\ber\bra\bal\bl w\bwo\bor\brd\bds\bs)\b)\n\n              The above creates a scalar parameter s\bsv\bva\bar\br and an array parameter\n              a\bav\bva\bar\br as if the assignments had been\n\n                     s\bsv\bva\bar\br=\b=\"\b\"o\bon\bne\be w\bwo\bor\brd\bd\"\b\"\n                     a\bav\bva\bar\br=\b=(\b(s\bse\bev\bve\ber\bra\bal\bl w\bwo\bor\brd\bds\bs)\b)\n\n              On the other hand:\n\n                     #\b# N\bNo\bor\brm\bma\bal\bl b\bbu\bui\bil\blt\bti\bin\bn i\bin\bnt\bte\ber\brf\bfa\bac\bce\be\n                     b\bbu\bui\bil\blt\bti\bin\bn t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt s\bsv\bva\bar\br=\b=$\b$(\b(e\bec\bch\bho\bo t\btw\bwo\bo w\bwo\bor\brd\bds\bs)\b)\n\n              The b\bbu\bui\bil\blt\bti\bin\bn keyword causes the above to use the standard builtin\n              interface to t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt in which argument parsing is performed in\n              the same way as for other commands.  This example creates a\n              scalar s\bsv\bva\bar\br containing the value t\btw\bwo\bo and another scalar\n              parameter w\bwo\bor\brd\bds\bs with no value.  An array value in this case\n              would either cause an error or be treated as an obscure set of\n              glob qualifiers.\n\n              Arbitrary arguments are allowed if they take the form of\n              assignments after command line expansion; however, these only\n              perform scalar assignment:\n\n                     v\bva\bar\br=\b='\b's\bsv\bva\bar\br=\b=v\bva\bal\bl'\b'\n                     t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt $\b$v\bva\bar\br\n\n              The above sets the scalar parameter s\bsv\bva\bar\br to the value v\bva\bal\bl.\n              Parentheses around the value within v\bva\bar\br would not cause array\n              assignment as they will be treated as ordinary characters when\n              $\b$v\bva\bar\br is substituted.  Any non-trivial expansion in the name part\n              of the assignment causes the argument to be treated in this\n              fashion:\n\n                     t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt {\b{v\bva\bar\br1\b1,\b,v\bva\bar\br2\b2,\b,v\bva\bar\br3\b3}\b}=\b=n\bna\bam\bme\be\n\n              The above syntax is valid, and has the expected effect of\n              setting the three parameters to the same value, but the command\n              line is parsed as a set of three normal command line arguments\n              to t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt after expansion.  Hence it is not possible to assign\n              to multiple arrays by this means.\n\n              Note that each interface to any of the commands may be disabled\n              separately.  For example, `d\bdi\bis\bsa\bab\bbl\ble\be -\b-r\br t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt' disables the\n              reserved word interface to t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt, exposing the builtin\n              interface, while `d\bdi\bis\bsa\bab\bbl\ble\be t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt' disables the builtin.  Note\n              that disabling the reserved word interface for t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt may cause\n              problems with the output of `t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt -\b-p\bp', which assumes the\n              reserved word interface is available in order to restore array\n              and associative array values.\n\n              Unlike parameter assignment statements, t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt's exit status on\n              an assignment that involves a command substitution does not\n              reflect the exit status of the command substitution.  Therefore,\n              to test for an error in a command substitution, separate the\n              declaration of the parameter from its initialization:\n\n                     #\b# W\bWR\bRO\bON\bNG\bG\n                     t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt v\bva\bar\br1\b1=\b=$\b$(\b(e\bex\bxi\bit\bt 1\b1)\b) |\b||\b| e\bec\bch\bho\bo \"\b\"T\bTr\bro\bou\bub\bbl\ble\be w\bwi\bit\bth\bh v\bva\bar\br1\b1\"\b\"\n\n                     #\b# R\bRI\bIG\bGH\bHT\bT\n                     t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt v\bva\bar\br1\b1 &\b&&\b& v\bva\bar\br1\b1=\b=$\b$(\b(e\bex\bxi\bit\bt 1\b1)\b) |\b||\b| e\bec\bch\bho\bo \"\b\"T\bTr\bro\bou\bub\bbl\ble\be w\bwi\bit\bth\bh v\bva\bar\br1\b1\"\b\"\n\n\n              To initialize a parameter _\bp_\ba_\br_\ba_\bm to a command output and mark it\n              readonly, use t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt -\b-r\br _\bp_\ba_\br_\ba_\bm or r\bre\bea\bad\bdo\bon\bnl\bly\by _\bp_\ba_\br_\ba_\bm after the\n              parameter assignment statement.\n\n              If no attribute flags are given, and either no _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be arguments\n              are present or the flag +\b+m\bm is used, then each parameter name\n              printed is preceded by a list of the attributes of that\n              parameter (a\bar\brr\bra\bay\by, a\bas\bss\bso\boc\bci\bia\bat\bti\bio\bon\bn, e\bex\bxp\bpo\bor\brt\bte\bed\bd, f\bfl\blo\boa\bat\bt, i\bin\bnt\bte\beg\bge\ber\br,\n              r\bre\bea\bad\bdo\bon\bnl\bly\by, or u\bun\bnd\bde\bef\bfi\bin\bne\bed\bd for autoloaded parameters not yet\n              loaded).  If +\b+m\bm is used with attribute flags, and all those\n              flags are introduced with +\b+, the matching parameter names are\n              printed but their values are not.\n\n              The following control flags change the behavior of t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt:\n\n              +\b+      If `+\b+' appears by itself in a separate word as the last\n                     option, then the names of all parameters (functions with\n                     -\b-f\bf) are printed, but the values (function bodies) are\n                     not.  No _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be arguments may appear, and it is an error\n                     for any other options to follow `+\b+'.  The effect of `+\b+'\n                     is as if all attribute flags which precede it were given\n                     with a `+\b+' prefix.  For example, `t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt -\b-U\bU +\b+' is\n                     equivalent to `t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt +\b+U\bU' and displays the names of all\n                     arrays having the uniqueness attribute, whereas `t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt\n                     -\b-f\bf -\b-U\bU +\b+' displays the names of all autoloadable\n                     functions.  If +\b+ is the only option, then type\n                     information (array, readonly, etc.) is also printed for\n                     each parameter, in the same manner as `t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt +\b+m\bm \"\b\"*\b*\"\b\"'.\n\n              -\b-g\bg     The -\b-g\bg (global) means that any resulting parameter will\n                     not be restricted to local scope.  Note that this does\n                     not necessarily mean that the parameter will be global,\n                     as the flag will apply to any existing parameter (even if\n                     unset) from an enclosing function.  This flag does not\n                     affect the parameter after creation, hence it has no\n                     effect when listing existing parameters, nor does the\n                     flag +\b+g\bg have any effect except in combination with -\b-m\bm\n                     (see below).\n\n              -\b-m\bm     If the -\b-m\bm flag is given the _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be arguments are taken as\n                     patterns (use quoting to prevent these from being\n                     interpreted as file patterns).  With no attribute flags,\n                     all parameters (or functions with the -\b-f\bf flag) with\n                     matching names are printed (the shell option\n                     T\bTY\bYP\bPE\bES\bSE\bET\bT_\b_S\bSI\bIL\bLE\bEN\bNT\bT is not used in this case).\n\n                     If the +\b+g\bg flag is combined with -\b-m\bm, a new local parameter\n                     is created for every matching parameter that is not\n                     already local.  Otherwise -\b-m\bm applies all other flags or\n                     assignments to the existing parameters.\n\n                     Except when assignments are made with _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be=\b=_\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be, using\n                     +\b+m\bm forces the matching parameters and their attributes to\n                     be printed, even inside a function.  Note that -\b-m\bm is\n                     ignored if no patterns are given, so `t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt -\b-m\bm'\n                     displays attributes but `t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt -\b-a\ba +\b+m\bm' does not.\n\n              -\b-p\bp [ _\bn ]\n                     If the -\b-p\bp option is given, parameters and values are\n                     printed in the form of a typeset command with an\n                     assignment, regardless of other flags and options.  Note\n                     that the -\b-H\bH flag on parameters is respected; no value\n                     will be shown for these parameters.\n\n                     -\b-p\bp may be followed by an optional integer argument.\n                     Currently only the value 1\b1 is supported.  In this case\n                     arrays and associative arrays are printed with newlines\n                     between indented elements for readability.\n\n              -\b-T\bT [ _\bs_\bc_\ba_\bl_\ba_\br[=\b=_\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be] _\ba_\br_\br_\ba_\by[=\b=(\b(_\bv_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be ...)\b)] [ _\bs_\be_\bp ] ]\n                     This flag has a different meaning when used with -\b-f\bf; see\n                     below.  Otherwise the -\b-T\bT option requires zero, two, or\n                     three arguments to be present.  With no arguments, the\n                     list of parameters created in this fashion is shown.\n                     With two or three arguments, the first two are the name\n                     of a scalar and of an array parameter (in that order)\n                     that will be tied together in the manner of $\b$P\bPA\bAT\bTH\bH and\n                     $\b$p\bpa\bat\bth\bh.  The optional third argument is a single-character\n                     separator which will be used to join the elements of the\n                     array to form the scalar; if absent, a colon is used, as\n                     with $\b$P\bPA\bAT\bTH\bH.  Only the first character of the separator is\n                     significant; any remaining characters are ignored.\n                     Multibyte characters are not yet supported.\n\n                     Only one of the scalar and array parameters may be\n                     assigned an initial value (the restrictions on assignment\n                     forms described above also apply).\n\n                     Both the scalar and the array may be manipulated as\n                     normal.  If one is unset, the other will automatically be\n                     unset too.  There is no way of untying the variables\n                     without unsetting them, nor of converting the type of one\n                     of them with another t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt command; +\b+T\bT does not work,\n                     assigning an array to _\bs_\bc_\ba_\bl_\ba_\br is an error, and assigning a\n                     scalar to _\ba_\br_\br_\ba_\by sets it to be a single-element array.\n\n                     Note that both `t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt -\b-x\bxT\bT .\b..\b..\b.'  and `e\bex\bxp\bpo\bor\brt\bt -\b-T\bT .\b..\b..\b.'\n                     work, but only the scalar will be marked for export.\n                     Setting the value using the scalar version causes a split\n                     on all separators (which cannot be quoted).  It is\n                     possible to apply -\b-T\bT to two previously tied variables but\n                     with a different separator character, in which case the\n                     variables remain joined as before but the separator is\n                     changed.\n\n                     When an existing scalar is tied to a new array, the value\n                     of the scalar is preserved but no attribute other than\n                     export will be preserved.\n\n              Attribute flags that transform the final value (-\b-L\bL, -\b-R\bR, -\b-Z\bZ, -\b-l\bl,\n              -\b-u\bu) are only applied to the expanded value at the point of a\n              parameter expansion expression using `$\b$'.  They are not applied\n              when a parameter is retrieved internally by the shell for any\n              purpose.\n\n              The following attribute flags may be specified:\n\n              -\b-A\bA     The names refer to associative array parameters; see\n                     `Array Parameters' in _\bz_\bs_\bh_\bp_\ba_\br_\ba_\bm(1).\n\n              -\b-L\bL [ _\bn ]\n                     Left justify and remove leading blanks from the value\n                     when the parameter is expanded.  If _\bn is nonzero, it\n                     defines the width of the field.  If _\bn is zero, the width\n                     is determined by the width of the value of the first\n                     assignment.  In the case of numeric parameters, the\n                     length of the complete value assigned to the parameter is\n                     used to determine the width, not the value that would be\n                     output.\n\n                     The width is the count of characters, which may be\n                     multibyte characters if the M\bMU\bUL\bLT\bTI\bIB\bBY\bYT\bTE\bE option is in\n                     effect.  Note that the screen width of the character is\n                     not taken into account; if this is required, use padding\n                     with parameter expansion flags $\b${\b{(\b(m\bml\bl_\b._\b._\b.)\b)_\b._\b._\b.}\b} as described\n                     in `Parameter Expansion Flags' in _\bz_\bs_\bh_\be_\bx_\bp_\bn(1).\n\n                     When the parameter is expanded, it is filled on the right\n                     with blanks or truncated if necessary to fit the field.\n                     Note truncation can lead to unexpected results with\n                     numeric parameters.  Leading zeros are removed if the -\b-Z\bZ\n                     flag is also set.\n\n              -\b-R\bR [ _\bn ]\n                     Similar to -\b-L\bL, except that right justification is used;\n                     when the parameter is expanded, the field is left filled\n                     with blanks or truncated from the end.  May not be\n                     combined with the -\b-Z\bZ flag.\n\n              -\b-U\bU     For arrays (but not for associative arrays), keep only\n                     the first occurrence of each duplicated value.  This may\n                     also be set for tied parameters (see -\b-T\bT) or\n                     colon-separated special parameters like P\bPA\bAT\bTH\bH or F\bFI\bIG\bGN\bNO\bOR\bRE\bE,\n                     etc.  Note the flag takes effect on assignment, and the\n                     type of the variable being assigned to is determinative;\n                     for variables with shared values it is therefore\n                     recommended to set the flag for all interfaces, e.g.\n                     `t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt -\b-U\bU P\bPA\bAT\bTH\bH p\bpa\bat\bth\bh'.\n\n                     This flag has a different meaning when used with -\b-f\bf; see\n                     below.\n\n              -\b-Z\bZ [ _\bn ]\n                     Specially handled if set along with the -\b-L\bL flag.\n                     Otherwise, similar to -\b-R\bR, except that leading zeros are\n                     used for padding instead of blanks if the first non-blank\n                     character is a digit.  Numeric parameters are specially\n                     handled: they are always eligible for padding with\n                     zeroes, and the zeroes are inserted at an appropriate\n                     place in the output.\n\n              -\b-a\ba     The names refer to array parameters.  An array parameter\n                     may be created this way, but it may be assigned to in the\n                     t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt statement only if the reserved word form of\n                     t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt is enabled (as it is by default).  When\n                     displaying, both normal and associative arrays are shown.\n\n              -\b-f\bf     The names refer to functions rather than parameters.  No\n                     assignments can be made, and the only other valid flags\n                     are -\b-t\bt, -\b-T\bT, -\b-k\bk, -\b-u\bu, -\b-U\bU and -\b-z\bz.  The flag -\b-t\bt turns on\n                     execution tracing for this function; the flag -\b-T\bT does the\n                     same, but turns off tracing for any named (not anonymous)\n                     function called from the present one, unless that\n                     function also has the -\b-t\bt or -\b-T\bT flag.  The -\b-u\bu and -\b-U\bU flags\n                     cause the function to be marked for autoloading; -\b-U\bU also\n                     causes alias expansion to be suppressed when the function\n                     is loaded.  See the description of the `a\bau\but\bto\bol\blo\boa\bad\bd' builtin\n                     for details.\n\n                     Note that the builtin f\bfu\bun\bnc\bct\bti\bio\bon\bns\bs provides the same basic\n                     capabilities as t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt -\b-f\bf but gives access to a few\n                     extra options; a\bau\but\bto\bol\blo\boa\bad\bd gives further additional options\n                     for the case t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt -\b-f\bfu\bu and t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt -\b-f\bfU\bU.\n\n              -\b-h\bh     Hide: only useful for special parameters (those marked\n                     `<S>' in the table in _\bz_\bs_\bh_\bp_\ba_\br_\ba_\bm(1)), and for local\n                     parameters with the same name as a special parameter,\n                     though harmless for others.  A special parameter with\n                     this attribute will not retain its special effect when\n                     made local.  Thus after `t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt -\b-h\bh P\bPA\bAT\bTH\bH', a function\n                     containing `t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt P\bPA\bAT\bTH\bH' will create an ordinary local\n                     parameter without the usual behaviour of P\bPA\bAT\bTH\bH.\n                     Alternatively, the local parameter may itself be given\n                     this attribute; hence inside a function `t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt -\b-h\bh P\bPA\bAT\bTH\bH'\n                     creates an ordinary local parameter and the special P\bPA\bAT\bTH\bH\n                     parameter is not altered in any way.  It is also possible\n                     to create a local parameter using `t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt +\b+h\bh _\bs_\bp_\be_\bc_\bi_\ba_\bl',\n                     where the local copy of _\bs_\bp_\be_\bc_\bi_\ba_\bl will retain its special\n                     properties regardless of having the -\b-h\bh attribute.  Global\n                     special parameters loaded from shell modules (currently\n                     those in z\bzs\bsh\bh/\b/m\bma\bap\bpf\bfi\bil\ble\be and z\bzs\bsh\bh/\b/p\bpa\bar\bra\bam\bme\bet\bte\ber\br) are automatically\n                     given the -\b-h\bh attribute to avoid name clashes.\n\n              -\b-H\bH     Hide value: specifies that t\bty\byp\bpe\bes\bse\bet\bt will not display the\n                     value of the parameter when listing parameters; the\n                     display for such parameters is always as if the `+\b+' flag\n                     had been given.  Use of the parameter is in other\n                     respects normal, and the option does not apply if the\n                     parameter is specified by name, or by pattern with the -\b-m\bm\n                     option.  This is on by default for the parameters in the\n                     z\bzs\bsh\bh/\b/p\bpa\bar\bra\bam\bme\bet\bte\ber\br and z\bzs\bsh\bh/\b/m\bma\bap\bpf\bfi\bil\ble\be modules.  Note, however,\n                     that unlike the -\b-h\bh flag this is also useful for\n                     non-special parameters.\n\n              -\b-i\bi [ _\bn ]\n                     Use an internal integer representation.  If _\bn is nonzero\n                     it defines the output arithmetic base, otherwise it is\n                     determined by the first assignment.  Bases from 2 to 36\n                     inclusive are allowed.\n\n              -\b-E\bE [ _\bn ]\n                     Use an internal double-precision floating point\n                     representation.  On output the variable will be converted\n                     to scientific notation.  If _\bn is nonzero it defines the\n                     number of significant figures to display; the default is\n                     ten.\n\n              -\b-F\bF [ _\bn ]\n                     Use an internal double-precision floating point\n                     representation.  On output the variable will be converted\n                     to fixed-point decimal notation.  If _\bn is nonzero it\n                     defines the number of digits to display after the decimal\n                     point; the default is ten.\n\n              -\b-l\bl     Convert the result to lower case whenever the parameter\n                     is expanded.  The value is _\bn_\bo_\bt converted when assigned.\n\n              -\b-r\br     The given _\bn_\ba_\bm_\bes are marked readonly.  Note that if _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be\n                     is a special parameter, the readonly attribute can be\n                     turned on, but cannot then be turned off.\n\n                     If the P\bPO\bOS\bSI\bIX\bX_\b_B\bBU\bUI\bIL\bLT\bTI\bIN\bNS\bS option is set, the readonly\n                     attribute is more restrictive: unset variables can be\n                     marked readonly and cannot then be set; furthermore, the\n                     readonly attribute cannot be removed from any variable.\n\n                     It is still possible to change other attributes of the\n                     variable though, some of which like -\b-U\bU or -\b-Z\bZ would affect\n                     the value. More generally, the readonly attribute should\n                     not be relied on as a security mechanism.\n\n                     Note that in zsh (like in pdksh but unlike most other\n                     shells) it is still possible to create a local variable\n                     of the same name as this is considered a different\n                     variable (though this variable, too, can be marked\n                     readonly). Special variables that have been made readonly\n                     retain their value and readonly attribute when made\n                     local.\n\n              -\b-t\bt     Tags the named parameters.  Tags have no special meaning\n                     to the shell.  This flag has a different meaning when\n                     used with -\b-f\bf; see above.\n\n              -\b-u\bu     Convert the result to upper case whenever the parameter\n                     is expanded.

If the -\b-H\bH flag is\n              given use hard limits instead of soft limits.  If the -\b-S\bS flag is\n              given together with the -\b-H\bH flag set both hard and soft limits.\n\n              If no options are used, the file size limit (-\b-f\bf) is assumed.\n\n              If _\bl_\bi_\bm_\bi_\bt is omitted the current value of the specified resources\n              are printed.  When more than one resource value is printed, the\n              limit name and unit is printed before each value.\n\n              When looping over multiple resources, the shell will abort\n              immediately if it detects a badly formed argument.  However, if\n              it fails to set a limit for some other reason it will continue\n              trying to set the remaining limits.\n\n              Not all the following resources are supported on all systems.\n              Running u\bul\bli\bim\bmi\bit\bt -\b-a\ba will show which are supported.\n\n              -\b-a\ba     Lists all of the current resource limits.\n              -\b-b\bb     Socket buffer size in bytes (N.B. not kilobytes)\n              -\b-c\bc     512-byte blocks on the size of core dumps.\n              -\b-d\bd     Kilobytes on the size of the data segment.\n              -\b-f\bf     512-byte blocks on the size of files written.\n              -\b-i\bi     The number of pending signals.\n              -\b-k\bk     The number of kqueues allocated.\n              -\b-l\bl     Kilobytes on the size of locked-in memory.\n              -\b-m\bm     Kilobytes on the size of physical memory.\n              -\b-n\bn     open file descriptors.\n              -\b-p\bp     The number of pseudo-terminals.\n              -\b-q\bq     Bytes in POSIX message queues.\n              -\b-r\br     Maximum real time priority.

This may be used to set\n              the limits for resources known to the shell which do not\n              correspond to option letters.  Such limits will be shown by\n              number in the output of `u\bul\bli\bim\bmi\bit\bt -\b-a\ba'.\n\n              The number may alternatively be out of the range of limits\n              compiled into the shell.  The shell will try to read or write\n              the limit anyway, and will report an error if this fails.\n\n       u\bum\bma\bas\bsk\bk [ -\b-S\bS ] [ _\bm_\ba_\bs_\bk ]\n              The umask is set to _\bm_\ba_\bs_\bk.  _\bm_\ba_\bs_\bk can be either an octal number or\n              a symbolic value as described in the _\bc_\bh_\bm_\bo_\bd(1) man page.  If _\bm_\ba_\bs_\bk\n              is omitted, the current value is printed.  The -\b-S\bS option causes\n              the mask to be printed as a symbolic value.  Otherwise, the mask\n              is printed as an octal number.  Note that in the symbolic form\n              the permissions you specify are those which are to be allowed\n              (not denied) to the users specified.\n\n       u\bun\bna\bal\bli\bia\bas\bs [ -\b-a\bam\bms\bs ] _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be ...\n              Removes aliases.  This command works the same as u\bun\bnh\bha\bas\bsh\bh -\b-a\ba,\n              except that the -\b-a\ba option removes all regular or global aliases,\n              or with -\b-s\bs all suffix aliases: in this case no _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be arguments\n              may appear.  The options -\b-m\bm (remove by pattern) and -\b-s\bs without\n              -\b-a\ba (remove listed suffix aliases) behave as for u\bun\bnh\bha\bas\bsh\bh -\b-a\ba.  Note\n              that the meaning of -\b-a\ba is different between u\bun\bna\bal\bli\bia\bas\bs and u\bun\bnh\bha\bas\bsh\bh.\n\n       u\bun\bnf\bfu\bun\bnc\bct\bti\bio\bon\bn\n              Same as u\bun\bnh\bha\bas\bsh\bh -\b-f\bf.\n\n       u\bun\bnh\bha\bas\bsh\bh [ -\b-a\bad\bdf\bfm\bms\bs ] _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be ...\n              Remove the element named _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be from an internal hash table.  The\n              default is remove elements from the command hash table.

The -\b-d\bd\n              options causes u\bun\bnh\bha\bas\bsh\bh to remove named directories.  If the -\b-m\bm\n              flag is given the arguments are taken as patterns (should be\n              quoted) and all elements of the corresponding hash table with\n              matching names will be removed.\n\n       u\bun\bnl\bli\bim\bmi\bit\bt [ -\b-h\bhs\bs ] _\br_\be_\bs_\bo_\bu_\br_\bc_\be ...\n              The resource limit for each _\br_\be_\bs_\bo_\bu_\br_\bc_\be is set to the hard limit.\n              If the -\b-h\bh flag is given and the shell has appropriate\n              privileges, the hard resource limit for each _\br_\be_\bs_\bo_\bu_\br_\bc_\be is\n              removed.

There is a limit on the\n              number of process IDs remembered by the shell; this is given by\n              the value of the system configuration parameter C\bCH\bHI\bIL\bLD\bD_\b_M\bMA\bAX\bX.  When\n              this limit is reached, older process IDs are discarded, least\n              recently started processes first.\n\n              Note there is no protection against the process ID wrapping,\n              i.e. if the wait is not executed soon enough there is a chance\n              the process waited for is the wrong one.  A conflict implies\n              both process IDs have been generated by the shell, as other\n              processes are not recorded, and that the user is potentially\n              interested in both, so this problem is intrinsic to process IDs.\n\n       w\bwh\bhe\ben\bnc\bce\be [ -\b-v\bvc\bcw\bwf\bfp\bpa\bam\bms\bsS\bS ] [ -\b-x\bx _\bn_\bu_\bm ] _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be ...\n              For each _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be, indicate how it would be interpreted if used as a\n              command name.\n\n              If _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be is not an alias, built-in command, external command,\n              shell function, hashed command, or a reserved word, the exit\n              status shall be non-zero, and -- if -\b-v\bv, -\b-c\bc, or -\b-w\bw was passed --\n              a message will be written to standard output.

This allows faster\n              autoloading of functions and sourcing of scripts by avoiding\n              parsing of the text when the files are read.\n\n              The first form (without the -\b-c\bc, -\b-a\ba or -\b-t\bt options) creates a\n              compiled file.  If only the _\bf_\bi_\bl_\be argument is given, the output\n              file has the name `_\bf_\bi_\bl_\be.\b.z\bzw\bwc\bc' and will be placed in the same\n              directory as the _\bf_\bi_\bl_\be.  The shell will load the compiled file\n              instead of the normal function file when the function is\n              autoloaded; see the section `Autoloading Functions' in\n              _\bz_\bs_\bh_\bm_\bi_\bs_\bc(1) for a description of how autoloaded functions are\n              searched.  The extension .\b.z\bzw\bwc\bc stands for `zsh word code'.\n\n              If there is at least one _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be argument, all the named files are\n              compiled into the output _\bf_\bi_\bl_\be given as the first argument.  If\n              _\bf_\bi_\bl_\be does not end in .\b.z\bzw\bwc\bc, this extension is automatically\n              appended.  Files containing multiple compiled functions are\n              called `digest' files, and are intended to be used as elements\n              of the F\bFP\bPA\bAT\bTH\bH/f\bfp\bpa\bat\bth\bh special array.\n\n              The second form, with the -\b-c\bc or -\b-a\ba options, writes the compiled\n              definitions for all the named functions into _\bf_\bi_\bl_\be.  For -\b-c\bc, the\n              names must be functions currently defined in the shell, not\n              those marked for autoloading.  Undefined functions that are\n              marked for autoloading may be written by using the -\b-a\ba option, in\n              which case the f\bfp\bpa\bat\bth\bh is searched and the contents of the\n              definition files for those functions, if found, are compiled\n              into _\bf_\bi_\bl_\be.  If both -\b-c\bc and -\b-a\ba are given, names of both defined\n              functions and functions marked for autoloading may be given.  In\n              either case, the functions in files written with the -\b-c\bc or -\b-a\ba\n              option will be autoloaded as if the K\bKS\bSH\bH_\b_A\bAU\bUT\bTO\bOL\bLO\bOA\bAD\bD option were\n              unset.\n\n              The reason for handling loaded and not-yet-loaded functions with\n              different options is that some definition files for autoloading\n              define multiple functions, including the function with the same\n              name as the file, and, at the end, call that function.  In such\n              cases the output of `z\bzc\bco\bom\bmp\bpi\bil\ble\be -\b-c\bc' does not include the\n              additional functions defined in the file, and any other\n              initialization code in the file is lost.  Using `z\bzc\bco\bom\bmp\bpi\bil\ble\be -\b-a\ba'\n              captures all this extra information.\n\n              If the -\b-m\bm option is combined with -\b-c\bc or -\b-a\ba, the _\bn_\ba_\bm_\bes are used\n              as patterns and all functions whose names match one of these\n              patterns will be written. If no _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be is given, the definitions\n              of all functions currently defined or marked as autoloaded will\n              be written.\n\n              Note the second form cannot be used for compiling functions that\n              include redirections as part of the definition rather than\n              within the body of the function; for example\n\n                     f\bfn\bn1\b1(\b()\b) {\b{ {\b{ .\b..\b..\b. }\b} >\b>~\b~/\b/l\blo\bog\bgf\bfi\bil\ble\be }\b}\n\n              can be compiled but\n\n                     f\bfn\bn1\b1(\b()\b) {\b{ .\b..\b..\b. }\b} >\b>~\b~/\b/l\blo\bog\bgf\bfi\bil\ble\be\n\n              cannot.  It is possible to use the first form of z\bzc\bco\bom\bmp\bpi\bil\ble\be to\n              compile autoloadable functions that include the full function\n              definition instead of just the body of the function.\n\n              The third form, with the -\b-t\bt option, examines an existing\n              compiled file.  Without further arguments, the names of the\n              original files compiled into it are listed.  The first line of\n              output shows the version of the shell which compiled the file\n              and how the file will be used (i.e. by reading it directly or by\n              mapping it into memory).  With arguments, nothing is output and\n              the return status is set to zero if definitions for _\ba_\bl_\bl _\bn_\ba_\bm_\bes\n              were found in the compiled file, and non-zero if the definition\n              for at least one _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be was not found.\n\n              Other options:\n\n              -\b-U\bU     Aliases are not expanded when compiling the _\bn_\ba_\bm_\bed files.\n\n              -\b-R\bR     When the compiled file is read, its contents are copied\n                     into the shell's memory, rather than memory-mapped (see\n                     -\b-M\bM).  This happens automatically on systems that do not\n                     support memory mapping.\n\n                     When compiling scripts instead of autoloadable functions,\n                     it is often desirable to use this option; otherwise the\n                     whole file, including the code to define functions which\n                     have already been defined, will remain mapped,\n                     consequently wasting memory.\n\n              -\b-M\bM     The compiled file is mapped into the shell's memory when\n                     read. This is done in such a way that multiple instances\n                     of the shell running on the same host will share this\n                     mapped file.  If neither -\b-R\bR nor -\b-M\bM is given, the z\bzc\bco\bom\bmp\bpi\bil\ble\be\n                     builtin decides what to do based on the size of the\n                     compiled file.\n\n              -\b-k\bk\n              -\b-z\bz     These options are used when the compiled file contains\n                     functions which are to be autoloaded. If -\b-z\bz is given, the\n                     function will be autoloaded as if the K\bKS\bSH\bH_\b_A\bAU\bUT\bTO\bOL\bLO\bOA\bAD\bD option\n                     is _\bn_\bo_\bt set, even if it is set at the time the compiled\n                     file is read, while if the -\b-k\bk is given, the function will\n                     be loaded as if K\bKS\bSH\bH_\b_A\bAU\bUT\bTO\bOL\bLO\bOA\bAD\bD _\bi_\bs set.  These options also\n                     take precedence over any -\b-k\bk or -\b-z\bz options specified to\n                     the a\bau\but\bto\bol\blo\boa\bad\bd builtin. If neither of these options is\n                     given, the function will be loaded as determined by the\n                     setting of the K\bKS\bSH\bH_\b_A\bAU\bUT\bTO\bOL\bLO\bOA\bAD\bD option at the time the\n                     compiled file is read.\n\n                     These options may also appear as many times as necessary\n                     between the listed _\bn_\ba_\bm_\bes to specify the loading style of\n                     all following functions, up to the next -\b-k\bk or -\b-z\bz.\n\n                     The created file always contains two versions of the\n                     compiled format, one for big-endian machines and one for\n                     small-endian machines.  The upshot of this is that the\n                     compiled file is machine independent and if it is read or\n                     mapped, only one half of the file is actually used (and\n                     mapped).\n\n       z\bzf\bfo\bor\brm\bma\bat\bt\n              See the section `The zsh/zutil Module' in _\bz_\bs_\bh_\bm_\bo_\bd_\bu_\bl_\be_\bs(1).\n\n       z\bzf\bft\btp\bp   See the section `The zsh/zftp Module' in _\bz_\bs_\bh_\bm_\bo_\bd_\bu_\bl_\be_\bs(1).\n\n       z\bzl\ble\be    See the section `Zle Builtins' in _\bz_\bs_\bh_\bz_\bl_\be(1).\n\n       z\bzm\bmo\bod\bdl\blo\boa\bad\bd [ -\b-d\bdL\bL ] [ -\b-s\bs ] [ ... ]\n       z\bzm\bmo\bod\bdl\blo\boa\bad\bd -\b-F\bF [ -\b-a\bal\blL\bLm\bme\be -\b-P\bP _\bp_\ba_\br_\ba_\bm ] _\bm_\bo_\bd_\bu_\bl_\be [ [+\b+-\b-]_\bf_\be_\ba_\bt_\bu_\br_\be ... ]\n       z\bzm\bmo\bod\bdl\blo\boa\bad\bd -\b-e\be [ -\b-A\bA ] [ ... ]\n       z\bzm\bmo\bod\bdl\blo\boa\bad\bd [ -\b-a\ba [ -\b-b\bbc\bcp\bpf\bf [ -\b-I\bI ] ] ] [ -\b-i\biL\bL ] ...\n       z\bzm\bmo\bod\bdl\blo\boa\bad\bd -\b-u\bu [ -\b-a\bab\bbc\bcd\bdp\bpf\bf [ -\b-I\bI ] ] [ -\b-i\biL\bL ] ...\n       z\bzm\bmo\bod\bdl\blo\boa\bad\bd -\b-A\bA [ -\b-L\bL ] [ _\bm_\bo_\bd_\ba_\bl_\bi_\ba_\bs[=\b=_\bm_\bo_\bd_\bu_\bl_\be] ... ]\n       z\bzm\bmo\bod\bdl\blo\boa\bad\bd -\b-R\bR _\bm_\bo_\bd_\ba_\bl_\bi_\ba_\bs ...\n              Performs operations relating to zsh's loadable modules.

This is\n                     appropriate if the caller considers the module optional.\n\n                     With -\b-u\bu, z\bzm\bmo\bod\bdl\blo\boa\bad\bd unloads modules.  The same _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be must be\n                     given that was given when the module was loaded, but it\n                     is not necessary for the module to exist in the file\n                     system.  The -\b-i\bi option suppresses the error if the module\n                     is already unloaded (or was never loaded).\n\n                     Each module has a boot and a cleanup function.  The\n                     module will not be loaded if its boot function fails.\n                     Similarly a module can only be unloaded if its cleanup\n                     function runs successfully.\n\n              z\bzm\bmo\bod\bdl\blo\boa\bad\bd -\b-F\bF [ -\b-a\bal\blm\bmL\bLe\be -\b-P\bP _\bp_\ba_\br_\ba_\bm ] _\bm_\bo_\bd_\bu_\bl_\be [ [+\b+-\b-]_\bf_\be_\ba_\bt_\bu_\br_\be ... ]\n                     z\bzm\bmo\bod\bdl\blo\boa\bad\bd -\b-F\bF allows more selective control over the\n                     features provided by modules.  With no options apart from\n                     -\b-F\bF, the module named _\bm_\bo_\bd_\bu_\bl_\be is loaded, if it was not\n                     already loaded, and the list of _\bf_\be_\ba_\bt_\bu_\br_\bes is set to the\n                     required state.  If no _\bf_\be_\ba_\bt_\bu_\br_\bes are specified, the module\n                     is loaded, if it was not already loaded, but the state of\n                     features is unchanged.  Each feature may be preceded by a\n                     +\b+ to turn the feature on, or -\b- to turn it off; the +\b+ is\n                     assumed if neither character is present.  Any feature not\n                     explicitly mentioned is left in its current state; if the\n                     module was not previously loaded this means any such\n                     features will remain disabled.  The return status is zero\n                     if all features were set, 1 if the module failed to load,\n                     and 2 if some features could not be set (for example, a\n                     parameter couldn't be added because there was a different\n                     parameter of the same name) but the module was loaded.\n\n                     The standard features are builtins, conditions,\n                     parameters and math functions; these are indicated by the\n                     prefix `b\bb:\b:', `c\bc:\b:' (`C\bC:\b:' for an infix condition), `p\bp:\b:' and\n                     `f\bf:\b:', respectively, followed by the name that the\n                     corresponding feature would have in the shell.  For\n                     example, `b\bb:\b:s\bst\btr\brf\bft\bti\bim\bme\be' indicates a builtin named s\bst\btr\brf\bft\bti\bim\bme\be\n                     and p\bp:\b:E\bEP\bPO\bOC\bCH\bHS\bSE\bEC\bCO\bON\bND\bDS\bS indicates a parameter named\n                     E\bEP\bPO\bOC\bCH\bHS\bSE\bEC\bCO\bON\bND\bDS\bS.  The module may provide other (`abstract')\n                     features of its own as indicated by its documentation;\n                     these have no prefix.\n\n                     With -\b-l\bl or -\b-L\bL, features provided by the module are\n                     listed.  With -\b-l\bl alone, a list of features together with\n                     their states is shown, one feature per line.  With -\b-L\bL\n                     alone, a z\bzm\bmo\bod\bdl\blo\boa\bad\bd -\b-F\bF command that would cause enabled\n                     features of the module to be turned on is shown.

Each feature may be preceded by\n                     +\b+ or -\b- but the character has no effect.  If no set of\n                     features is provided, all features are considered.\n\n                     With -\b-e\be, the command first tests that the module is\n                     loaded; if it is not, status 1 is returned.  If the\n                     module is loaded, the list of features given as an\n                     argument is examined.  Any feature given with no prefix\n                     is simply tested to see if the module provides it; any\n                     feature given with a prefix +\b+ or -\b- is tested to see if is\n                     provided and in the given state.  If the tests on all\n                     features in the list succeed, status 0 is returned, else\n                     status 1.\n\n                     With -\b-m\bm, each entry in the given list of features is\n                     taken as a pattern to be matched against the list of\n                     features provided by the module.  An initial +\b+ or -\b- must\n                     be given explicitly.  This may not be combined with the\n                     -\b-a\ba option as autoloads must be specified explicitly.\n\n                     With -\b-a\ba, the given list of features is marked for\n                     autoload from the specified module, which may not yet be\n                     loaded.  An optional +\b+ may appear before the feature\n                     name.  If the feature is prefixed with -\b-, any existing\n                     autoload is removed.  The options -\b-l\bl and -\b-L\bL may be used\n                     to list autoloads.  Autoloading is specific to individual\n                     features; when the module is loaded only the requested\n                     feature is enabled.  Autoload requests are preserved if\n                     the module is subsequently unloaded until an explicit\n                     `z\bzm\bmo\bod\bdl\blo\boa\bad\bd -\b-F\bFa\ba _\bm_\bo_\bd_\bu_\bl_\be -\b-_\bf_\be_\ba_\bt_\bu_\br_\be' is issued.  It is not an\n                     error to request an autoload for a feature of a module\n                     that is already loaded.\n\n                     When the module is loaded each autoload is checked\n                     against the features actually provided by the module; if\n                     the feature is not provided the autoload request is\n                     deleted.  A warning message is output; if the module is\n                     being loaded to provide a different feature, and that\n                     autoload is successful, there is no effect on the status\n                     of the current command.  If the module is already loaded\n                     at the time when z\bzm\bmo\bod\bdl\blo\boa\bad\bd -\b-F\bFa\ba is run, an error message is\n                     printed and status 1 returned.\n\n                     z\bzm\bmo\bod\bdl\blo\boa\bad\bd -\b-F\bFa\ba can be used with the -\b-l\bl, -\b-L\bL, -\b-e\be and -\b-P\bP\n                     options for listing and testing the existence of\n                     autoloadable features.

If\n                     the module _\bm_\bo_\bd_\ba_\bl_\bi_\ba_\bs is ever subsequently requested,\n                     either via a call to z\bzm\bmo\bod\bdl\blo\boa\bad\bd or implicitly, the shell\n                     will attempt to load _\bm_\bo_\bd_\bu_\bl_\be instead.  If _\bm_\bo_\bd_\bu_\bl_\be is not\n                     given, show the definition of _\bm_\bo_\bd_\ba_\bl_\bi_\ba_\bs.  If no arguments\n                     are given, list all defined module aliases.  When\n                     listing, if the -\b-L\bL flag was also given, list the\n                     definition as a z\bzm\bmo\bod\bdl\blo\boa\bad\bd command to recreate the alias.\n\n                     The existence of aliases for modules is completely\n                     independent of whether the name resolved is actually\n                     loaded as a module: while the alias exists, loading and\n                     unloading the module under any alias has exactly the same\n                     effect as using the resolved name, and does not affect\n                     the connection between the alias and the resolved name\n                     which can be removed either by z\bzm\bmo\bod\bdl\blo\boa\bad\bd -\b-R\bR or by\n                     redefining the alias.  Chains of aliases (i.e. where the\n                     first resolved name is itself an alias) are valid so long\n                     as these are not circular.  As the aliases take the same\n                     format as module names, they may include path separators:\n                     in this case, there is no requirement for any part of the\n                     path named to exist as the alias will be resolved first.\n                     For example, `a\ban\bny\by/\b/o\bol\bld\bd/\b/a\bal\bli\bia\bas\bs' is always a valid alias.\n\n                     Dependencies added to aliased modules are actually added\n                     to the resolved module; these remain if the alias is\n                     removed.  It is valid to create an alias whose name is\n                     one of the standard shell modules and which resolves to a\n                     different module.  However, if a module has dependencies,\n                     it will not be possible to use the module name as an\n                     alias as the module will already be marked as a loadable\n                     module in its own right.\n\n                     Apart from the above, aliases can be used in the z\bzm\bmo\bod\bdl\blo\boa\bad\bd\n                     command anywhere module names are required.  However,\n                     aliases will not be shown in lists of loaded modules with\n                     a bare `z\bzm\bmo\bod\bdl\blo\boa\bad\bd'.\n\n              z\bzm\bmo\bod\bdl\blo\boa\bad\bd -\b-R\bR _\bm_\bo_\bd_\ba_\bl_\bi_\ba_\bs ...\n                     For each _\bm_\bo_\bd_\ba_\bl_\bi_\ba_\bs argument that was previously defined as\n                     a module alias via z\bzm\bmo\bod\bdl\blo\boa\bad\bd -\b-A\bA, delete the alias.  If any\n                     was not defined, an error is caused and the remainder of\n                     the line is ignored.\n\n              Note that z\bzs\bsh\bh makes no distinction between modules that were\n              linked into the shell and modules that are loaded dynamically.\n              In both cases this builtin command has to be used to make\n              available the builtins and other things defined by modules\n              (unless the module is autoloaded on these definitions). This is\n              true even for systems that don't support dynamic loading of\n              modules.\n\n       z\bzp\bpa\bar\brs\bse\beo\bop\bpt\bts\bs\n              See the section `The zsh/zutil Module' in _\bz_\bs_\bh_\bm_\bo_\bd_\bu_\bl_\be_\bs(1).\n\n       z\bzp\bpr\bro\bof\bf  See the section `The zsh/zprof Module' in _\bz_\bs_\bh_\bm_\bo_\bd_\bu_\bl_\be_\bs(1).\n\n       z\bzp\bpt\bty\by   See the section `The zsh/zpty Module' in _\bz_\bs_\bh_\bm_\bo_\bd_\bu_\bl_\be_\bs(1).\n\n       z\bzr\bre\beg\bge\bex\bxp\bpa\bar\brs\bse\be\n              See the section `The zsh/zutil Module' in _\bz_\bs_\bh_\bm_\bo_\bd_\bu_\bl_\be_\bs(1).\n\n       z\bzs\bso\boc\bck\bke\bet\bt\n              See the section `The zsh/net/socket Module' in _\bz_\bs_\bh_\bm_\bo_\bd_\bu_\bl_\be_\bs(1).\n\n       z\bzs\bst\bty\byl\ble\be See the section `The zsh/zutil Module' in _\bz_\bs_\bh_\bm_\bo_\bd_\bu_\bl_\be_\bs(1).\n\n       z\bzt\btc\bcp\bp   See the section `The zsh/net/tcp Module' in _\bz_\bs_\bh_\bm_\bo_\bd_\bu_\bl_\be_\bs(1).\n\nzsh 5.9                          May 14, 2022                   ZSHBUILTINS(1)\n"
